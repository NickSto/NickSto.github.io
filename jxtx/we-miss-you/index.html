<blockquote class="blockquote">
This is just such devastating news. I have known James for the best part of seven years, as we set up Galaxy in Australia and James, of course, immediately agreed to visit in 2013 to help make that happen. He was visionary, looking to create free, open platforms for global science. <br /><br />
He was also enormously good company, going out for beers and in depth discussions on any and all topics. I thoroughly enjoyed James' company in social and academic forums...but far more importantly than that, he both led and built software and data science communities that will define community-focussed global bioscience from here on. <br /><br />
Personally, it's crushing - I am so sorry for his family and friends, of which of course I count myself - but the loss to the world of science eclipses that. We are all the poorer for losing James. If it is any consolation, he accomplished so much - the world of science is changed because of James.

My friend James Taylor is dead. I'm heartbroken and thinking of all of his family and friends. He is leaving a hole that cannot be filled.<br /><br />
I met James when I started grad school at Penn State. I had no idea what to expect (I'd only learned of PhD programs within the previous year). We were both students, but he was clearly in a league of his own.<br /><br />
James was one of the smartest people I've ever known, in a way that wasn't (as) intimidating. Talking with James was easy and enlightening. He advocated and put in the work for better science, in all aspects.<br /><br />
James supported my science and my career in ways I don't think I can ever fully communicate. As a colleague, he believed in me. As a friend, he expected me to do good. He supported my growth, selflessly.<br /><br />
Most of all, James was an advocate. <br /><br />
He advocated for his students, for trainees, for open science, for open data, for making this world a better place. <br /><br />
<p>I will miss him so terribly.</p>

James was so approachable. Though we never got the chance to collaborate directly, when I first met *the* James Taylor I remember feeling that approachability in that someone so famous in our field would always take the time out to talk to me about science or about whatever the topic of the moment was. We had many conversations - some just a glance across a busy crowd at a conference where that would be our only acknowledgement, some,  hours long chats. The first memory that came to mind thinking back now was the many weeks he spent at CSHL instructing at courses in the fall. There were months when he was on campus more than I was. The particular memory that flashed when I heard this news was finishing a beer with him around 2 am in the cold outside the bar at Blackford. The bar had long closed, but we were having a crazy conversation along with one other course instructor about awful American TV shows. The conversation was of course punctuated with thoughts on comparative genomics. James was brilliant, but it wasn’t this that made him a star, helped him build a global community, or an enduring vision. He was a lovable and decent human being who will be fondly remembered. His work and the community he helped to create will live on. For every researcher who continues his legacy and works to live up to his achievements, don’t forget to bring along also his charm, curiosity, compassion, and love.

I was fortunate to be introduced to James via the IU/TACC Jetstream project, where he promised to consume large quantities of CPU time on behalf of the Galaxy project. His vision and his plans for achieving it were both straightforward and clear. In short: Give us a key to your system (an API key, in this case), and we will make sure it's used for good. And he delivered, spectacularly! While this straightforward approach might at first appear naive, he articulated his plans clearly and proved soundly that he could do it. He was always ready to share examples of discoveries that had been enabled by Galaxy. In later visits on other topics, I was impressed by his astute understanding of how the research community works and how to make (important, substantive) things happen. People like him are rare and special, and a joy to encounter and work with. This is a heavy loss for the research community.

I met James over five years ago though the Galaxy Community, and I believe that his personality and role as co-founder helped shape that positive and welcoming atmosphere. Looking back it is clear that he and Anton convinced funders of the importance of community building, evident in how the Galaxy Project funded and has continued to fund dedicated staff for community, outreach and training. James cared both about people and principles - he was also vocal on open science and open data, embodied in the Galaxy platform's ethos of reproducible research. Just days ago, he was tweeting complaints about how in a pandemic so much new covid19 viral sequence data was not being shared openly (as in the NCBI/INSDC), but instead under restricted terms in the GISAID database. It is clear from the posts of his students, mentees, collaborators and friends, that while he would have achieved much more, he has already built a legacy we can all be proud of.

James was an incredibly kind teacher and friend.  You could tell he was truly passionate about teaching and building others up around him.

<p>I still remember going up to James during one of his lectures and expressing that I was skeptical of many of the available bioinformatic tools.  I was a bit shocked when he replied, "You should be incredibly skeptical.  You should use most of them and trust none of them."   I really admired this intellectual honesty, how he was able to teach and rely on many tools while still being highly objective and critical of them.  That is something I will always remember about him and carry with me as a guiding principle in the years to come.<br /><br /></p>

Community building is so hard and so important. If we are talking about sustainability, this almost ever means to maintain and grow a community. Galaxy will be soon 15 years old. You and your team did it! Thanks for everything that you have given us James. I will miss you.

The world of genomics, bioinformatics, and to a great extent, current biology has lost a pioneer. Galaxy has been there for almost a decade and a half and was so ahead of its time. Your work has advanced science significantly and will be carried on. RIP & condolences to family

This is truly very sad, my deepest condolences to his family, friends and to the Galaxy community. I had the chance of meeting James briefly during the last GCC, a very nice person and true advocate of open science and open source. RIP James.

I came in today and found this in front of James’ office.

I met James at a Galaxy Community developers conference in the first year of my PhD and was taken aback by how friendly he and his team were and welcoming to all as equals.  A great admirer and user of his work and saddened by this loss.

It's been a couple weeks now, and I still feel like it is so surreal that this could have happened. I didn't know James super well but he will always be the voice I hear announcing the state of the Galaxy during the community conference. He had a hand in so many initiatives and was so central to the communities I'm a part of, I'm left wondering how the world will possibly go on without his leadership.
