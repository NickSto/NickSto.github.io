(and computational resources?)</h2><h3 id="standalone-server"><a href="#standalone-server" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Standalone Server</h3><ol><li>We are currently running Galaxy on a standalone server but we are trying to integrate it within our computing cluster running LSF.</li><li>We haven't installed it yet but we are planning to use a standalone workstation - Dell C6145 system using the 16-core AMD processors.  This chassis includes two discrete systems, each with 64 2.3 ghz cpu cores, 128GB RAM, and 9 2.5” drives and we'll be using one chassis for the Galaxy install along with LifeScope from Life Technologies.</li><li>Standalone workstation, 8 cores , 16 GB RAM</li><li>We use a standalone server with four quad-core Intel X7350 and 128GB memory. This server is currently also used for individual logins. We are in the process of making it the dedicated Galaxy server on which Galaxy is the only service running.</li><li>Galaxy installed for local use in our group (4 persons) is running on a Centos 6.2 virtual machine on Redhat6.2 host using KVM. The Galaxy virtual machine has 8 cores and 24GB RAM, and is run on a dedicated logical volume. The host has 24 cores and 96GB RAM.</li><li>We currently have Galaxy hosted on our small analysis server (24Gb RAM, 8 cores). We're hoping to put it on a much larger production server later this year.</li><li>Standalone server, HP Blade, 10 core, 32 GB Memory,</li></ol><h3 id="in-transition--multiple"><a href="#in-transition--multiple" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>In Transition / Multiple</h3><ol><li>Galaxy is currently deployed on a Dell Quad Xeon 5150, 20GB RAM, 7TB partition. Once we have proof of need, we plan to integrate the application with our 2000 core cluster using PBS, 10Gb interconnect, and Panasas storage.</li><li>Large memory (1TB), multi-core (8 core x 4 threads) server.  Moving towards a PBS/Torque cluster.</li><li>We run Galaxy on a multi-core server with a healthy dose of RAM and a beefy RAID storage. This currently runs most of the compute jobs for Galaxy. <br>The storage is mapped to a modest SGE cluster, which is currently used for BLAST jobs from Galaxy (with the intention of moving more tools to the cluster).</li><li>Currently experimenting with a trial version on 8 node/12 core cluster (96GB/node, 8GB core) running SGE; also using 8 core VM version (non-cluster).</li><li>We have two instances. One is a standalone machine for testing and learning purpose. This is a 4-cpu server with 8GB memory. The other instance is installed on the cluster with about 5500 cores. This cluster is running all the analysis and research computing within OICR. It is under SGE. We also use Amazon cloud when doing our workshops.</li><li>We are currently running on a 64-core server. Right now we're trying to get an instance running on a ~5000-processor  PBS cluster.</li><li>At the moment it is currently running on a Linux Ubuntu virtual server. It is not part of a cluster or anything fancy. Running on an 8gb machine with 2 cores currently.  We have replaced SQLlite with postgres and have it running on an apache server. We also have set up proFTP.</li><li>Standalone server: 24 core, ~60Gb RAM.  No cluster although we do have an instance running but not in use on our local SGE cluster</li><li>I just ordered a large standalone server. It should arrive in a few weeks, when I'll begin setting up a beta installation. If this gains traction, I hope to deploy it on the university's cluster.</li></ol><h3 id="compute-cluster"><a href="#compute-cluster" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Compute Cluster</h3><ol><li>Galaxy is running on a compute cluster with 4 nodes, and 4 GB per node.  We are using Rocks as our infrastructure with PBS.</li><li>4 node SGE cluster</li><li>Job and web runners are on a single node that's also hosting a pgsql database for the Galaxy metadata. All jobs are run on a SGE cluster using the drmaa adapter. Number of cores used for the Galaxy instance changes depending on the demand. The head node has 8xL5420@2.50GHz cores and 16Gb of RAM. The cluster nodes have 12xX5675@3.07GHz cores and 96Gb of RAM.</li><li>Galaxy is hosted on a computer cluster. Each computer node of the cluster has 8 cores with 12G memory.  Torque PBS is the resource manager.</li><li>Dell blades/m1000e chassis; 128 cores; 1TB RAM;  72TB raw array storage; ubuntu 11.10; SGE;</li><li>My Galaxy instance is integrated with a computing cluster (SGE).</li><li>We plan to deploy a galaxy instance on a ~1000 CPU blade cluster + fat nodes. We expect to have it coupled with PBS PRO queueing system. We are still evaluating the possibility of having galaxy frontend in a virtual machine communicating with the postgres db and cluster system as backend.</li><li>We have two Galaxy environments.</li><li>A QA (Quality Assurance) Galaxy env which dispatches jobs to a small closed cluster managed by SGE.</li><li>A Production Galaxy env (in alpha phase) which is a submit node to our campus High Performance Compute cluster managed by SGE.   Our production galaxy box has 24 GB Ram and is a 12 core, infiniband network card.
We decided to strip back the amount of tools installed to only a small subset, with plans to lazily expose more tools upon request of users.  We plan to develop and publish common analysis pipelines for common work being currently done at the U of I.</li><li>Integrated with a large compute cluster using PBS/Torque.

These 'aborted' jobs would continue to run on the cluster however the galaxy server would have not recover or re-monitor their state. We had fixed it locally by ignoring 'DrmCommunicationException' returned by the drmaa-python library.

For example, fastq.gz files are uncompressed and sam/bam files are sorted during the upload process. We have seen some silent failures during some of these preprocessing steps, especially in uncompressing of fastq.gz files. Frequently, that uncompress produces a truncated or corrupted .fastq file, with no indication of error in Galaxy, which results in mysterious failures or incorrect results from down-stream analyses. Fixing that is important. Having checksums computed &amp; displayed for both the original compressed files and the final uncompressed file available in &quot;info&quot; would help a lot.</li></ol><h3 id="cluster-setup-issues"><a href="#cluster-setup-issues" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Cluster Setup Issues</h3><ol><li>The major problem for the time being is the cluster integration.</li><li>The pbs_python adapter I used with Torque at the prototype stage was very leaky - required constant monitoring and restarts of the Galaxy job runner.</li><li>Configuring Galaxy and our Cluster to talk to each other was surprisingly complicated.</li><li>SLURM was used as the resource manager at the beginning, but it turned out Galaxy doesn't like it very well, so we had to switch to Torque PBS instead.</li><li>NFS latency. When galaxy is installed on an NFS shared folder instead of the local hard drive, the job runner does not communicate with  Torque PBS very well.</li><li>We had to work around python versioning issues.  Our server has a supported version of python (v2.7) but our cluster has an outdated one (v. 2.4), so we ran into problems when initially deploying Galaxy with various incompatibilities between the two versions.</li><li>No job or dataset specific control on cluster resource requirements: The galaxy's DRMAA configuration is tool specific and not job specific. This doesn't play in a shared cluster/scheduler environment. This is an on-going issue and a major limitation for shared cluster environments. It would be nice to have an option for either of following options:</li><li>Allow users to specify resource limits</li><li>Make DRMAA configuration data-set dependent.
Right now there's now way for a job submitter to easily select different resource requests (like RAM) depending on the size/complexity of the genome being worked on (eg, human[big] vs vaccinia virus[very small] vs tree-shrew[thousands of contigs]). Thus, we have to size resource requests for the biggest possible data set, which causes the small runs to wait a LONG time in the queue for resources they don't need. Nor does it seem possible to set up a formula for DRMAA based on the size of the genome being used (ie, make the choice automatically). This is compounded by lack of good data on the performance/requirements of many of the underlying programs for different input types).</li><li>Capturing 'failed/aborted' jobs by the scheduler: There are cases (listed below) where a job is aborted by the scheduler but it still shows up as successful in the galaxy (green-boxes):</li><li><a href="https://lists.galaxyproject.org/archives/list/galaxy-dev@lists.galaxyproject.org/thread/3RYYE6ZNPM7I4NXTUNQPZ5UQQA7KXIWH/#WD3H7EGA6IPERH6VEJXFTQBBA3DANGJQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Job exceeds requested resource limits such as memory and run-time</a></li><li>Compute node on which job was running fails/restarted</li></ol><p>Job failures because of # 2 rarely happen however # 1 is very common if you have a shared cluster environment and galaxy tool's drmaa/job-runner configuration is not liberal (e.g. configure tool with 64GB RAM, 96-hrs run-time..).
<br>
Such jobs get correctly marked with non-zero exit state (failed jobs) in the scheduler's accounting file. However, this failure state is not captured correctly by the galaxy or underlying drmaa libraries. Some tools give/capture empty dataset output while others capture partially complete output. Since the galaxy shows such failed job with successful/green-box state end-users expect a valid dataset output. Also, since a job is marked with a 'successful' state in the galaxy, all the subsequent analysis steps which use this job's output are run with an invalid dataset input. This results in wrong analysis which may or may not get detected depending on the tool and user! This inability to tell if a job was really successful (false positives) is becoming a major reason for people to avoid galaxy: they don't know if they can believe their results.</p><ol><li>Used drmaa libraries for cluster runner (<a href="http://apps.man.poznan.pl/trac/slurm-drmaa/downloads" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://apps.man.poznan.pl/trac/slurm-drmaa/downloads</a>)</li><li>Used Dalhö's routine (<a href="http://mdahlo.blogspot.com/2011/06/galaxy-on-uppmax.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://mdahlo.blogspot.com/2011/06/galaxy-on-uppmax.html</a>) to make it run on our cluster</li></ol><h3 id="security-and-ftp-setup-issues"><a href="#security-and-ftp-setup-issues" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Security and FTP Setup Issues</h3><ol><li>Integration into the Single Signon system is still an issue.

We used sharepoint.</li><li>Documentation</li><li>We've had our galaxy instance for close to 2 years at this point.  It took much longer to get a production instance of galaxy set up than we expected it would.  Getting a simple instance of galaxy up is relatively easy, but getting a production instance up was very time consuming.  We ended having to hire an &quot;application administrator&quot; to manage the instance and the associated HTS data movement.  It's not clear to me if an instance would be as hard to install today.</li></ol><h2 id="what-limitations-have-you-experienced-in-hosting-galaxy-and-satisfying-end-user-requirements"><a href="#what-limitations-have-you-experienced-in-hosting-galaxy-and-satisfying-end-user-requirements" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>What limitations have you experienced in hosting Galaxy and satisfying end user requirements?</h2><h3 id="very-few-limitations"><a href="#very-few-limitations" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Very Few Limitations</h3><ol><li>Not in production yet.</li><li>Not yet but expect to encounter these once user base starts to grow.</li><li>We have only tested a little bit and have not had too much feedback currently.</li><li>none so far.</li><li>(blank x 10)</li></ol><h3 id="capacity-limitations"><a href="#capacity-limitations" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Capacity Limitations</h3><ol><li>Disk space.  Galaxy stores intermediate step files which can be large.</li><li>Our most common complaints have more to do with the underlying (lack of) compute power rather than any complaints about Galaxy itself. Most of our users think that Galaxy is an excellent tool.</li></ol><h3 id="tool-definition-limitations"><a href="#tool-definition-limitations" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Tool Definition Limitations</h3><ol><li>Users always complain about the lack of wrappers for their favorite tools. I've been writing wrappers, but the amount of time I can devote to that is not big, so the process is too slow to make my users happy.</li><li>The description and naming of the tools is sometimes plainly misleading. Even with the search tool, people often do not find a simple tool they are looking for. A threat to Galaxy.</li><li>Quality of tool wrappers: (Wrappers missing inputs or outputs) a lot of galaxy wrappers don't have all the parameters for the underlying tools, and many &quot;throw away&quot; valuable outputs &amp; log files - like &quot;unmapped reads&quot; from tophat. This pushes people outside of galaxy, if they want the extra parameters or need those output.</li><li>I am trying hard to find out how can I read logged-in user's database ID, when a tool loads up. Because my tool meant to load up (in a dropdown) some custom data from a non-galaxy database for the user to select and submit a job.  I have posted this quest on Galaxy-Dev but in vein. <br>If I could find out this in this forum that would be great.</li><li>There needs to be an improved mechanism for supporting multiple tool versions and tool wrapper versions in the same galaxy.</li><li>Version handling of tools - while many tools report the version the dataset was run with, Galaxy does not give us good reproducibility - the wrappers generally run the latest version of the tool in the path, and assume the .loc files point to the indexes matching the latest version (say, BWA 0.5 vs 0.6). This means people can't go back and re-run analysis 6 months later to tweak parameters, without unknowingly moving to a new version of the tool - which may give completely different results. This can probably be handled in two manners:</li><li>Multiple versions of the same tool and tool wrappers (hard-coded with particular tool version) can be installed on the system.</li><li>Tool wrappers or some other component of galaxy can search PATH or environment modules to provide version specific tool option</li></ol><h3 id="user-history-and-dataset-handling-limitations"><a href="#user-history-and-dataset-handling-limitations" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>User History and Dataset Handling Limitations</h3><ol><li>There must be a built-in dataset export feature similar to the library loading from the filesystem. Galaxy is not an all-inclusive solution and the lack of an export capability for large datasets is a big problem.</li><li>We have several power-users who move in and out of galaxy over the course of their workflows, and easy of access to underlying files and ability to easily link or ingest files is critical. We would like this process to be even easier - ability to move files in/out through linux command line, ability for non-admin uses to &quot;link in&quot; files, mnemonic names of data files, etc.</li><li>naming of workflow steps - users are not happy that they must maintain a map of dataset 14 = sample1bc1 ...</li><li>We would like a better way in naming the output of the jobs rather than manually having to change the name.</li><li>there is no useful space for annotating histories.</li><li>No hierarchical dataset organisation for histories.</li><li>Hard to view &quot;structure&quot; of history - to see which datasets are parents/children of which others. Need a way to quickly highlight parents/children in history, or to draw and USE a structured/tree version of the history. For a simple, yet effective example, see Bugzilla display of bug dependencies (blocked by/blocks; <a href="http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/showdependencytree.cgi?id=3385" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/showdependencytree.cgi?id=3385</a>)</li><li>Multi-input-file-selection is great, but doesn't work with base tools, only with work flows. It also doesn't have a provision for dealing with Paired-End data (need parallel arrays of input FASTQs), which is almost entirely what we're working with!!</li><li>Data set deletion through the GUI is very laborious. Need at least multi-select and delete. For example - one click to delete all datasets from a failed cuffdiff run, or from a BWA run and all down-stream (dependent) analyses.</li><li>No easy way to visually tag datasets in a history - highlight yellow, etc, etc, in a way that shows up in the history itself. Folks often end up keeping a parallel history in excel.</li><li>Most of our users dislike the file management.   It's tedious to upload large numbers of files, move them back and forth between histories and libraries.  Selecting files, and histories for deletion can be quite tedious.  We have many users who do RNA Seq analysis with very large numbers of samples, and we've actually had to move some of these users out to the command-line and built command-line pipelines because it was easier for them to deal with a directory of files than select and move files within galaxy.  Submitting a workflow for many samples of paired-end sequence is impossible within galaxy (not literally, but no one wants to select 100 pairs of sequences).   Galaxy libraries can be incredibly slow to open when there are very large numbers of files in the libraries.</li></ol><h3 id="admin-dataset-handling-limitations"><a href="#admin-dataset-handling-limitations" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Admin Dataset Handling Limitations</h3><ol><li>Adding reference genomes/datasets is too ad-hoc at the moment.</li><li>Lack of out-of-the box scripts to download reference data, create required indices, and register them in the correct .loc files in galaxy, created a lot of busy work and and slowed-down adoption.</li></ol><h3 id="sample-tracking-limitations"><a href="#sample-tracking-limitations" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Sample Tracking Limitations</h3><ol><li>No meta-data on datasets for &quot;sample&quot; - we don't run a LIMS, but we usually start an analysis with a set of fastqs from several samples in the same history. We spend a LOT of time &quot;&quot;penciling&quot;&quot; datasets to add the sample name to the display title. Galaxy automatically tracks &quot;dbkey&quot; - it would make life <em>MUCH</em> easier if it also tracked &quot;sample name&quot; and displayed it prominently. If two (forward/rev) fastqs come from the same sample, and are BWA's to a reference genome, the resulting SAM, etc should also be tagged with the sample names.</li><li>We are looking for progress in the sample tracking system.</li></ol><h3 id="workflow-limitations"><a href="#workflow-limitations" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Workflow Limitations</h3><ol><li>Wish list: A way to submit an entire workflow as a single cluster job - workflows with many steps can take a lot of extra wall-time due to queue-wait. Some way to submit the entire workflow as a single cluster task would be very desirable.</li><li>Workflows are not flexible enough</li><li>Workflows can not be called as &quot;subroutines&quot; by other workflows. This forces duplication of sub-workflows, and creates an un-maintainable mess.</li><li>From the developer point-of-view, workflows with multiple inputs, MapReduce-like functionality (though these are apparently on the horizon).  Dealing with user large data in a conservative manner, e.g. less copying, more linking.  We haven't had any user issues yet, but we do anticipate things popping up :)</li><li>There should be an easier way to interoperate with other instances such as the public Galaxy instance, so users could migrate their data and records easier.</li></ol><h3 id="error-handling-limitations"><a href="#error-handling-limitations" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Error Handling Limitations</h3><ol><li>I keep running Galaxy at the debug logging level as it's the only way to quickly figure out user problems. Better diagnostic output would be a boon.</li><li>I think error handling is difficult.  Hard for end users to know if the problem was Galaxy, the tool, or their data.   We need better documentation for the code, and more complete APIs exposed for automating workflows from the command line.</li></ol><h3 id="authentication-user-and-job-management-limitations"><a href="#authentication-user-and-job-management-limitations" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Authentication, User and Job Management Limitations</h3><ol><li>Trying to host it on our HPC grid, but they require data to be owned by respective users for security, quotas, etc..  User data in Galaxy is owned by the galaxy user, even if the processes are run as logged in users.</li><li>One limitation is the number of processes allocated for a job is hard coded in the universe_wsgi.ini, we hope the number of processes for each job can be configured between different runs.</li><li>Using external authentication is nice, but it does cause some other limitations.</li><li>Difficult to implement IdP other than OpenID at WSGI level. We managed to do it at Apache proxy level with mellon package, but this rules out the common logging in Galaxy and we had to drop it. We plan to keep the Galaxy Scientific portal free and open to all academic institutions in the world (a better version of the php-based Bioportal, www.bioportal.uio.no)</li><li>The galaxy job runner does not support job specific configuration of the following:</li></ol><ul><li>run-time</li><li>memory</li><li>parallel environment</li></ul><ol><li>Our cluster has restriction when submitting jobs to it, for example, you have to specify how much memory you need and how long does the job last, but our galaxy instance is running as a single user. It is tedious to configure this for each tool and the memory needed also depends on the size of data set.</li></ol><h3 id="other-user-interface-limitations"><a href="#other-user-interface-limitations" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Other User Interface Limitations</h3><ol><li>Galaxy doesn't seem to work on IE9, history fails to refresh, peep view links broken.</li><li>Poor user feedback in interface for long running jobs - no progress indicator at all. Would be nice to be able to at least say 'running locally' or 'running on cluster' or 'queued on cluster'.</li><li>Lack of a &quot;progress&quot; indicator is hard for users. Ie. in a run of some hours, what %age finished are we, or what stage of processing are we up to. I have implemented an email system that sends progress emails to the user at intervals of N minutes which alleviates this.</li><li>GUI SPEED - we have a lot of long (several hundred step) workflows. They render slowly. We also run a &quot;consulting&quot; group, so each of us works on many projects at a time, often several for each of several clients (I have 50 histories for 6 clients, I think) - the &quot;saved histories&quot; link is slow, and there's no way to group histories into folders or to keep a search filter active.</li></ol><h3 id="other-limitations"><a href="#other-limitations" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Other Limitations</h3><ol><li>It's a web application so has all the associated warts and limitations.

I understand it is hard to document everything - but maybe a quick 1 hour discussion would help.</li><li>Perhaps first, what attract users to Galaxy, and what repels them? E.g. if they don't like using FTP upload, what are other options? If they don't find their ways in the menu's, should we change descriptions to our own experience. It is really important to get these issues known first, otherwise users won't use Galaxy, and we don't have to set up Galaxies.<br><br>And next, best practices of sysadmins that host 'big' galaxies.
