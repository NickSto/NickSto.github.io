Note that this means a tool needs to know which metadata values to pass on/create/modify, and tools may conflict on various tag structures or ontologies. This behavior may also be workflow-specific, e.g. in one workflow I might merge BAM files by sample, and in another I might merge them by group.

This was seen as a possible solution to the workflow flow control issue, as well as a more general data management mechanism.

FastQC output (which is an HTML report with a set of associated files that are not in your history) was used as an example. The key issue seems to be that the files referred to by a composite dataset do not themselves have any file-level metadata (including file type/format) and so can't be used in the normal way as inputs to other tools.

It may not be possible to immediately tell which component has caused the problem, either - one component may fail early in a workflow, but the fault is not exposed until many steps later.
