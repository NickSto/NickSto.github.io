In the beginning various manufacturers of sequencing instruments were free to interpret fastq as they saw fit, resulting in a multitude of fastq flavors. This variation stemmed primarily from different ways of encoding quality values as described <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a> (below you will find explanation of quality scores and their meaning). Today, <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20015970\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fastq Sanger</a> version of the format is considered to be the standard form of fastq. Galaxy is using fastq sanger as the only legitimate input for downstream processing tools and provides <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20562416\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a number of utilities for converting fastq files</a> into this form (see <strong>NGS: QC and manipulation</strong> section of Galaxy tools). </p>\n<p>Fastq format looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code>@M02286:19:000000000-AA549:1:1101:12677:1273 1:N:0:23\nCCTACGGGTGGCAGCAGTGAGGAATATTGGTCAATGGACGGAAGTCTGAACCAGCCAAGTAGCGTGCAG\n+\nABC8C,:@F:CE8,B-,C,-6-9-C,CE9-CC--C-&#x3C;-C++,,+;CE&#x3C;,,CD,CEFC,@E9&#x3C;FCFCF?9\n@M02286:19:000000000-AA549:1:1101:15048:1299 1:N:0:23\nCCTACGGGTGGCTGCAGTGAGGAATATTGGACAATGGTCGGAAGACTGATCCAGCCATGCCGCGTGCAG\n+\nABC@CC77CFCEG;F9&#x3C;F89&#x3C;9--C,CE,--C-6C-,CE:++7:,CF&#x3C;,CEF,CFGGD8FFCFCFEGCF\n@M02286:19:000000000-AA549:1:1101:11116:1322 1:N:0:23\nCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAGTAGGGAATCTTCGGCAATGGACGGAAGTCTGACCGAGCAACGCCGCGTGAGT\n+\nAAC&#x3C;CCF+@@>CC,C9,F9C9@9-CFFFE@7@:+CC8-C@:7,@EFE,6CF:+8F7EFEEF@EGGGEEE\n</code></pre>\n<p>Each sequencing read is represented by four lines:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><code>@</code> followed by read ID and optional information about sequencing run</li>\n<li>sequenced bases</li>\n<li><code>+</code> (optionally followed by the read ID and some additional info)</li>\n<li>quality scores for each base of the sequence encoded as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ASCII symbols</a></li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"paired-end-data\"><a href=\"#paired-end-data\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Paired end data</h2>\n<p>It is common to prepare pair-end and mate-pair sequencing libraries. This is highly beneficial for a number of applications discussed in subsequent topics.

Paired-end and mate-pair reads</strong>. In paired end sequencing (left) the actual ends of rather short DNA molecules (less than 1kb) are determined, while for mate pair sequencing (right) the ends of long molecules are joined and prepared in special sequencing libraries. In these mate pair protocols, the ends of long, size-selected molecules are connected with an internal adapter sequence (i.e. linker, yellow) in a circularization reaction. The circular molecule is then processed using restriction enzymes or fragmentation. Fragments are enriched for the linker and outer library adapters are added around the two combined molecule ends. The internal adapter can then be used as a second priming site for an additional sequencing reaction in the same orientation or sequencing can be performed from the second adapter, from the reverse strand.

The following excerpt from an excellent <a href=\"http://chagall.med.cornell.edu/RNASEQcourse/Intro2RNAseq.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tutorial</a> by Friederike Dündar, Luce Skrabanek, Paul Zumbo explains what base qualities are:</p>\n<div class=\"well well-lg\">\n<p>Illumina sequencing is based on identifying the individual nucleotides by the fluorescence signal emitted upon their incorporation into the growing sequencing read. Once the fluorescence intensities are extracted and translated into the four letter code. The deduction of nucleotide sequences from the images acquired during sequencing is commonly referred to as base calling. Due to the imperfect nature of the sequencing process and limitations of the optical instruments, base calling will always have inherent uncertainty. This is the reason why FASTQ files store the DNA sequence of each read together with a position-specific quality score that represents the error probability, i.e., how likely it is that an individual base call may be incorrect. The score is called <a href=\"http://www.phrap.com/phred/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Phred score</a>, $Q$, which is proportional to the probability $p$ that a base call is incorrect, where $Q = −10lg(p)$. For example, a Phred score of 10 corresponds to one error in every ten base calls ($Q = −10lg(0.1)$), or 90% accuracy; a Phred score of 20 corresponds to one error in every 100 base calls, or 99% accuracy. A higher Phred score thus reflects higher confidence in the reported base. To assign each base a unique score identifier (instead of numbers of varying character length), Phred scores are typically represented as ASCII characters. At <a href=\"http://ascii-code.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http://ascii-code.com/</a> you can see which characters are assigned to what number. For raw reads, the range of scores will depend on the sequencing technology and the base caller used (Illumina, for example, used a tool called Bustard, or, more recently, RTA). Unfortunately, Illumina has been anything but consistent in how they calculated and ASCII-encoded the Phred score (see below)! In addition, Illumina now allows Phred scores for base calls with as high as 45, while 41 used to be the maximum score until the HiSeq X. This may cause issues with downstream applications that expect an upper limit of 41.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/src/tutorials/ngs/illumina_qs.png\"></p>\n</div>\n<p>Base call qualities are represented using the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phred_quality_score\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Phred score scale</a>. Different Illumina (formerly Solexa) versions used different scores and ASCII offsets. Starting with Illumina format 1.8, the score now represents the standard\nSanger/Phred format that is also used by other sequencing platforms and the sequencing archives.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"/src/tutorials/ngs/fastq_qs.png\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><small><strong>Figure 4.</strong> The ASCII interpretation and ranges of the different Phred score notations used by Illumina and the original Sanger interpretation. Although the Sanger format allows a theoretical score of 93, raw sequencing reads typically do not exceed a Phred score of 60. In fact, most Illumina-based sequencing will result in maximum scores of 41 to 45 (image from [Wikipedia](<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki</a> FASTQ_format)).</small></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"assessing-data-quality\"><a href=\"#assessing-data-quality\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Assessing data quality</h2>\n<p>One of the first steps in the analysis of NGS data is seeing how good the data actually is. <a href=\"http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">FastQC</a> is a fantastic tool allowing you to evaluate the quality of fastq datasets (and deciding whether to blame or not to blame whoever has done sequencing for you). </p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\"></th>\n<th align=\"left\"></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><img src=\"/src/tutorials/ngs/good_fq.png\"></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><img src=\"/src/tutorials/ngs/bad_fq.png\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><small><strong>Figure 5. Left:</strong> Excellent quality.</small></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><small><strong>Right:</strong> Hmmmm....Ok.</small></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Here you can see FastQC base quality reports (the tools gives you many other types of data) for two datasets: <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong>. The <strong>A</strong> dataset has long reads (250 bp) and very good quality profile with no qualities dropping below <a href=\"http://www.phrap.com/phred/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">phred score</a> of 30. The <strong>B</strong> dataset is significantly worse with ends of the reads dipping below phred score of 20. The <strong>B</strong> reads may need to be trimmed for further processing. </p>\n<p>It may be challenging to use <code>fastQC</code> when you have a lot of datasets. For example, in our case there are four datasets. <code>FastQC</code> needs to be run on each dataset individually and then one needs to look at each <code>fastQC</code> report individually. This may not be a big problem for four datasets, but it will become an issue if you have 100s or 1,000s of datasets. <a href=\"https://github.com/ewels\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Phil Ewels</a> has developed a tool called <a href=\"http://multiqc.info/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><code>MultiQC</code></a> that allows to summarize multiple QC reports at once. To run <code>MultiQC</code> you need to run <code>fastQC</code> on individual datasets and then feed fastQC outputs to <code>MultiQC</code> (note that <code>MultiQC</code> is not limited to processing FastQC reports but accepts outputs of many other tools). Galaxy makes this easy as shown in the following video:</p>\n<div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9\"><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/123453134?portrait=0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>In this video we run <code>FastQC</code> on the four datasets and then summarized these data with <code>MultiQC</code>.

Because the process of cleaving terminators and color labels is not 100% efficient noise accumulates as run progresses and so bases at the ends of reads tend to have lower quality). There is a number of steps we can take to mitigate the effect of low quality bases. One is dynamically trim the reads:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>slide a window across reads</li>\n<li>at every step of the process calculate average quality of bases within the given window</li>\n<li>if quality drops below certain set threshold → stop and trim the read of the read from this point until the end</li>\n<li>output the beginning of the read</li>\n</ul>\n<p>One of the tools that performs this procedure is <a href=\"http://www.usadellab.org/cms/?page=trimmomatic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Trimmomatic</a> developed by Usadel <a href=\"http://www.usadellab.org/cms/index.php?page=staff\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">lab</a>.

The <code>hg38</code> contains all chromosomes as well as all unplaced contigs.

The binary form of the format (BAM) is compact and can be rapidly searched (if indexed). In Galaxy BAM datasets are always indexed (accompanies by a .bai file) and sorted in coordinate order. In the following discussion I once again rely on <a href=\"http://chagall.med.cornell.edu/RNASEQcourse/Intro2RNAseq.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tutorial</a> by Friederike Dündar, Luce Skrabanek, and Paul Zumbo.</p>\n<p>The Sequence Alignment/Map (SAM) format is a generic nucleotide alignment format that describes the alignment of sequencing reads (or query sequences) to a reference. The human readable, TAB-delimited SAM files can be compressed into the Binary Alignment/Map format. These BAM files are bigger than simply gzipped SAM files, because they have been optimized for fast random access rather than size reduction. Position-sorted BAM files can be indexed so that all reads aligning to a locus can be efficiently retrieved without loading the entire file into memory.</p>\n<p>As shown below, SAM files typically contain a header section and an alignment section where each row represents a single read alignment. The following sections will explain the SAM format in a bit more detail.

The decimal number is the sum of all the answers to the Yes/No questions associated with each binary bit. The hexadecimal representation is used to refer to the individual bits (questions). A bit is set if the corresponding state is true. For example, if a read is paired, <code>0x1</code> will be set, returning the decimal value of 1. Therefore, all <code>FLAG</code> values associated with paired reads must be uneven decimal numbers.

While the optional fields listed above are fairly standardized, tags that begin with <code>X</code>, <code>Y</code>, and <code>Z</code> are reserved for particularly free usage and will never be part of the official SAM file format specifications. <code>XS</code>, for example, is used by TopHat (an RNA-seq analysis tool we will discuss later) to encode the strand information (e.g., <code>XS:A:+</code>) while Bowtie2 and BWA use <code>XS:i:</code> for reads with multiple alignments to store the alignment score for the next-best-scoring alignment (e.g., <code>XS:i:30</code>).</p>\n<h2 id=\"read-groups\"><a href=\"#read-groups\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Read Groups</h2>\n<p>One of the key features of SAM/BAM format is the ability to label individual reads with readgroup tags.

It is required to generate sufficient number of sequencing templates so that a reliable detection can be performed by base callers. Yet PCR has it's biases, which are especially profound in cases of multitemplate PCR used for construction of sequencing libraries (Kanagawa et al. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&#x26;db=PubMed&#x26;dopt=Abstract&#x26;list_uids=16233530\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2003</a>). </p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"/src/tutorials/ngs/pcr-duplicates.png\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><small><strong>Figure 14</strong>. Analyzing molecules aligning with the same outer coordinates, a mapping quality of at least 30 and a length of at least 30nt, resulted in an average coverage of 12.9 per PCR duplicate and an empirical coverage distribution similar to an exponential/power law distribution (left upper panel). This indicates that many molecules are only observed for deeper sequencing while other molecules are available at higher frequencies. Analyzing length (left middle panel) and GC content (left lower panel) patterns as well as the combination (right panel) shows higher PCR duplicate counts for a GC content between 30% to 70% as well as for shorter molecules compared to longer molecules. This effect may be due to an amplification bias from the polymerase or the cluster generation process necessary for Illumina sequencing.

One of the common ways for identification of duplicate reads is the <code>MarkDuplicates</code> utility from <a href=\"https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/command-line-overview.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Picard</a> package. It is designed to identify both PCR and optical duplicates:</p>\n<div class=\"well well-lg\">\n<p>Duplicates are identified as read pairs having identical 5' positions (coordinate and strand) for both reads in a mate pair (and optionally, matching unique molecular identifier reads; see BARCODE_TAG option). Optical, or more broadly Sequencing, duplicates are duplicates that appear clustered together spatially during sequencing and can arise from optical/imagine-processing artifacts or from bio-chemical processes during clonal amplification and sequencing; they are identified using the READ_NAME_REGEX and the OPTICAL_DUPLICATE_PIXEL_DISTANCE options. The tool's main output is a new SAM or BAM file in which duplicates have been identified in the SAM flags field, or optionally removed (see REMOVE_DUPLICATE and REMOVE_SEQUENCING_DUPLICATES), and optionally marked with a duplicate type in the 'DT' optional attribute. In addition, it also outputs a metrics file containing the numbers of READ_PAIRS_EXAMINED, UNMAPPED_READS, UNPAIRED_READS, UNPAIRED_READ DUPLICATES, READ_PAIR_DUPLICATES, and READ_PAIR_OPTICAL_DUPLICATES.

This is because when sequencing target is small reads will have the same coordinates by chance and not because of PCR amplification issues. The figure below illustrates the fine balance between estimates allele frequency, coverage, and variation in insert size:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"/src/tutorials/ngs/sampling-bias.png\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><small><strong>Figure 15</strong>.

At this point we are happy with the quality of the data and ready to move on with the subsequent analysis. To do this we organize our datasets into a different type of collection - a paired collection.

This allows us to merge individual BAM datasets into one at the end of this analysis.) Next using Picard's <code>MarkDuplicates</code> tool we process output of <code>bwa mem</code>. This step produces two collections: (1) a collection of deduplicated BAMs and (2) a collection of duplicate metrics data produced by <code>MarkDuplicates</code> tool. We use <code>multiQC</code> to visualize the duplicate metrics. We then filter BAM collection produced by <code>MarkDuplicates</code> using <code>Filter SAM or BAM</code> tool to retain only properly mapped reads with mapping quality above 20 and mapping only to mitochondria (chrM).
