Much of Galaxy-related features described in this section have been developed by Björn Grüning (@bgruening) and configured by Dave Bouvier (@davebx).</p>\n<p>RNAseq can be roughly divided into two \"types\":</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Reference genome-based</strong> - an assembled genome exists for a species for which an RNAseq experiment is performed. It allows reads to be aligned against the reference genome and significantly improves our ability to reconstruct transcripts. This category would obviously include humans and most model organisms but excludes the majority of truly biologically interesting species (e.g., <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyacinth_macaw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hyacinth macaw</a>);</li>\n<li><strong>Reference genome-free</strong> - no genome assembly for the species of interest is available. In this case one would need to assemble the reads into transcripts using <em>de novo</em> approaches. This type of RNAseq is as much of an art as well as science because assembly is heavily parameter-dependent and difficult to do well.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In this lesson we will focus on the <strong>Reference genome-based</strong> type of RNA seq.</p>\n<h2 id=\"experimental-procedures-affect-downstream-analyses\"><a href=\"#experimental-procedures-affect-downstream-analyses\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Experimental procedures affect downstream analyses</h2>\n<p>The <em>Everything's connected</em> slide by Dündar et al. (2015) explains the overall idea:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/src/tutorials/rb_rnaseq/everything_connected.png\"></p>\n<p>There is a variety of ways in which RNA is treated during its conversion to cDNA and eventual preparation of sequencing libraries. In general the experimental workflow includes the following steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>RNA purification;</li>\n<li>Reverse transcription using Reverse Transcriptase (RT), which produces the first strand of cDNA (\"c\" stands for <em>complimentary</em>);</li>\n<li>Second strand synthesis using DNA polymerase;</li>\n<li>Library preparation for sequencing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In listing these basic steps we are ignoring a vast amount of details such as, for example, normalization strategies and procedures needed to deal with rare RNAs or degraded samples (see <a href=\"http://nature.com/nmeth/journal/v10/n7/full/nmeth.2483.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Adiconis:2013</a>). Yet, there are two important experimental considerations that would effect the ways in which one analyses data and interprets the results. These are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Priming for the first cDNA strand synthesis;</li>\n<li>Stranded versus Non-stranded libraries.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"priming-for-the-first-strand-synthesis\"><a href=\"#priming-for-the-first-strand-synthesis\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Priming for the first strand synthesis</h3>\n<p>Reverse Transcriptase (RT) requires a primer. One can leverage the fact that the majority of processed mRNAs are polyadenylated and use oligo-dT primer to (mostly) restrict cDNA synthesis to fully processed mRNAs. Alternatively one can use a mix of random oligonucleotides to prime RT at a multitude of internal sites irrespective of RNA type and maturation status:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"/src/tutorials/rb_rnaseq/dT_random.png\"></p>\n<p><strong>Oligo-dT vs. random priming</strong><br>\nOligo-dT (<strong>A</strong>) and random priming (<strong>B</strong>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Depending on the choice of the approach one would have different types of RNAs included in the final sequencing outcome. For example, if one attempts to study RNAs that are not polyadenylated or not fully processed, it would be unwise to use oligo-dT priming approach.</p>\n<h3 id=\"strand-specific-rnaseq\"><a href=\"#strand-specific-rnaseq\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Strand-specific RNAseq</h3>\n<p>RNAs that are typically targeted in RNAseq experiments are single stranded (e.g., mRNAs) and thus have polarity (5' and 3' ends that are functionally distinct):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"/src/tutorials/rb_rnaseq/dna_rna.png\"></p>\n<p><small><strong>Relationship between DNA and RNA orientation</strong></small></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>During a typical RNAseq experiment the information about strandedness is lost after both strands of cDNA are synthesized, size selected, and converted into sequencing library. However, this information can be quite useful for various aspects of RNAseq analysis such as transcript reconstruction and quantification. There is a number of methods for creating so called <em>stranded</em> RNAseq libraries that preserve the strand information (for an excellent overview see Levin et al. <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v7/n9/full/nmeth.1491.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2010</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v7/n9/fig_tab/nmeth.1491_F1.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"/src/tutorials/rb_rnaseq/stranded_protocols.png\"></a></p>\n<p><strong>Generation of stranded RNAseq libraries</strong><br>\nDifferent types of stranded library generation protocols from <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v7/n9/full/nmeth.1491.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Levin:2010</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Depending on the approach and whether one performs single- or paired-end sequencing there are multiple possibilities on how to interpret the results of mapping of these reads onto genome/transcriptome:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://sailfish.readthedocs.org/en/master/library_type.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"/src/tutorials/rb_rnaseq/lib_type.png\"></a></p>\n<p><strong>Effects of RNAseq library types</strong><br>\nImage and description below is from <a href=\"http://sailfish.readthedocs.org/en/master/library_type.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sailfish documentation</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The relative orientation of the reads is only relevant if the library is pair-ended. The possible options are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>I</strong> = inward;</li>\n<li><strong>O</strong> = outward;</li>\n<li><strong>M</strong> = matching (co-directional).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Library can be stranded (<strong>S</strong>) or unstranded (<strong>U</strong>). If this library is stranded than depending on the protocols reads (single reads or forward reads in a paired-end run) may originate from:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>F</strong> = read 1 in paired-end sequencing or single-end read is derived from the Forward strand;</li>\n<li><strong>R</strong> = read 1 in paired-end sequencing or single-end read is derived from the Reverse strand.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So by combining the relative orientation of reads is I, O, or M (if reads are paired), strandedness or the library (S or U), and whether the reads originate from forward and reverse strand (F or R) there can be quite a number of possibilities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>IU  - (an unstranded paired-end library where the reads face each other)</li>\n<li>SF  - (a stranded single-end protocol where the reads come from the forward strand)</li>\n<li>OSR - (a stranded paired-end protocol where the reads face away from each other,\nread1 comes from reverse strand and read2 comes from the forward strand).\nand so on...</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, in practice, if you use Illumina paired-end RNAseq protocols you are unlikely to uncover many of these possibilities. You will either deal with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>unstranded RNAseq data (<strong>IU</strong> type from above. Also called <strong>fr-unstranded</strong> in TopHat/Cufflinks jargon);</li>\n<li>stranded RNAseq data produced with Illumina TrueSeq RNAseq kits and <a href=\"http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/37/18/e123\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">dUTP tagging</a> (<strong>ISR</strong> type from above or <strong>fr-firststrand</strong> in TopHat/Cufflinks nomenclature).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The implication of stranded RNAseq is that you can distinguish whether the reads are derived from forward- or reverse-encoded transcripts:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"/src/tutorials/rb_rnaseq/stranded_result.png\"></p>\n<p><strong>Stranded RNAseq data look like this</strong><br>\nThis example contrasts unstranded and stranded RNAseq experiments. <span style=\"color: red;\">Red transcripts</span> are from + strand and <span style=\"color: blue;\">blue</span> are from - strand.

Replicates are essential to be able to correct for variation due to differences within/among organisms, cells, sequencing machines, library preparation protocols and numerous other potential factors. There are two types of replicates (as described by <a href=\"http://chagall.med.cornell.edu/RNASEQcourse/Intro2RNAseq.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dündar:2015</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Technical replicates</strong> can be defined as <em>different library preparations from the same RNA sample</em>. They should account for batch effects from the library preparation such as reverse transcription and PCR amplification. To avoid possible lane effects (e.g., differences in the sample loading, cluster amplification, and efficiency of the sequencing reaction), it is good practice to multiplex the same sample over different lanes of the same flowcell. In most cases, technical variability introduced by the sequencing protocol is quite low and well controlled.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Biological replicates</strong>. There is an on-going debate over what kinds of samples represent true biological replicates. Obviously, the variability between different samples will be greater between RNA extracted from two unrelated humans than between RNA extracted from two different batches of the same cell line. In the latter case, most of the variation that will eventually be detected was probably introduced by the experimenter (e.g., slightly differing media and plating conditions). Nevertheless, this is variation the researcher is typically not interested in assessing, therefore the ENCODE consortium defines biological replicates as RNA from an independent growth of cells/tissue (ENCODE <a href=\"https://genome.ucsc.edu/ENCODE/protocols/dataStandards/ENCODE_RNAseq_Standards_V1.0.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2011</a>).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The number of replicates should be as high as practically possible. Most RNAseq experiments include three replicates and some have as many as 12 (see Schurch et al. <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.02017\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2015</a>).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"read-mapping\"><a href=\"#read-mapping\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Read mapping</h2>\n<p>After sequencing is performed you have a collection of sequencing reads for each sample/replicate. In a reference-based RNAseq experiment these need to be mapped against the genome. Because in the case of eukaryotic transcriptome most reads originate from processed mRNAs lacking exons, they cannot be simply mapped back to the genome. Instead they can be separated into two categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reads that map entirely within exons</li>\n<li>Reads that cannot be mapped within an exon across their entire length because they span two or more exons</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Spliced</em> mappers have been developed to efficiently map transcript-derived reads against genome.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tophat-tophat2-and-hisat\"><a href=\"#tophat-tophat2-and-hisat\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>TopHat, TopHat2, and HiSat</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/25/9/1105.abstract\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tophat</a> was one of the first tools designed specifically to address this problem by identifying potential exons using reads that do map to the genome, generating possible splices between neighboring exons, and comparing reads that did not initially map to the genome against these <em>in silico</em> created junctions:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/25/9/1105/F1.expansion.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"/src/tutorials/rb_rnaseq/tophat.png\"></a></p>\n<p><strong>TopHat and TopHat2: Mapping RNAseq regions to genome</strong><br>\nIn TopHat reads are mapped against the genome and are separated into two categories: (1) those that map, and (2) those that initially unmapped (IUM). \"Piles\" of reads representing potential exons are extended in search of potential donor/acceptor splice sites and potential splice junctions are reconstructed. IUMs are then mapped to these junctions.

It uses a set of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FM-index\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">FM-indices</a> consisting one global genome-wide index and a collection of ~48,000 local overlapping 42 kb indices (~55,000 56 kb indices in HiSat2). This allows to find initial seed locations for potential read alignments in the genome using global index and to rapidly refine these alignments using a corresponding local index:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"/src/tutorials/rb_rnaseq/hisat.png\"></p>\n<p><strong>Hierarchical Graph FM index in HiSat/HiSat2</strong><br>\nA part of the read (blue arrow) is first mapped to the genome using the global FM index. The HiSat then tries to extend the alignment directly utilizing the genome sequence (violet arrow). In (<strong>a</strong>) it succeeds and this read aligned as it completely resides within an exon. In (<strong>b</strong>) the extension hits a mismatch. Now HiSat takes advantage of the local FM index overlapping this location to find the appropriate matting for the remainder of this read (green arrow). The (<strong>c</strong>) shows a combination these two strategies: the beginning of the read is mapped using global FM index (blue arrow), extended until it reaches the end of the exon (violet arrow), mapped using local FM index (green arrow) and extended again (violet arrow).

It operates in <a href=\"http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2012/10/25/bioinformatics.bts635.abstract\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">two stages</a>. In the first stage it performs seed search:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"/src/tutorials/rb_rnaseq/star.png\"></p>\n<p><strong>STAR's seed search</strong><br>\nHere a read is split between two consecutive exons. STAR starts to look for a <em>maximum mappable prefix</em> (MMP) from the beginning of the read until it can no longer match continuously. After this point it start to MMP for the unmatched portion of the read (<strong>a</strong>). In the case of mismatches (<strong>b</strong>) and unalignable regions (<strong>c</strong>) MMPs serve as anchors from which to extend alignments.

A scoring scheme is used to evaluate and prioritize stitching combinations and to evaluate reads that map to multiple locations. STAR is extremely fast but requires a substantial amount of RAM to run efficiently.</p>\n<h2 id=\"transcript-reconstruction\"><a href=\"#transcript-reconstruction\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Transcript reconstruction</h2>\n<p>The previous step - mapping - assigns RNAseq reads to genomic locations and identifies splice junctions from reads that originate from different exons. At transcript reconstruction step this information is taken further in attempt to build transcript models. There is a number of tools for performing this task. A benchmarking paper by <a href=\"http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/09/03/bioinformatics.btv488.full.pdf+html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hayer:2015</a> attempted to compare performance of existing approaches with one of the outcomes shown below:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/09/08/bioinformatics.btv488/F5.large.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"/src/tutorials/rb_rnaseq/rnaseq_comparison.png\"></a></p>\n<p><strong>Comparison of transcript reconstruction approaches</strong><br>\nHere <em>recall</em> (the number of correctly constructed forms divided by the total number of real forms) versus <em>precision</em> (true positives divided by the sum of true positives and false positives) are plotted for seven transcript assemblers tested on two simulated datasets: <em>EnsemblPerfect</em> and <em>EnsemblRealistic</em>. The shaded region is indicating suboptimal performance (i.e., the white, unshaded region is \"good\").

The following discussion is based on inner workings of StringTie.</p>\n<h3 id=\"transcriptome-assembly-with-stringtie\"><a href=\"#transcriptome-assembly-with-stringtie\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Transcriptome assembly with StringTie</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/stringtie/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">StringTie</a> assembles transcripts from spliced read alignments produced by tools such as STAR, TopHat, or HISAT and simultaneously estimates their abundances using counts of reads assigned to each transcript. The following images illustrates details of StringTie workflow:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"/src/tutorials/rb_rnaseq/stringtie1.png\"></p>\n<p><strong>StringTie workflow</strong><br>\nImage from <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v33/n3/full/nbt.3122.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pertea:2015</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In essence StringTie builds an alternative splice graph from overlapping reads in a given locus. In such a graph nodes correspond to exons (or, rather, contiguous regions of genome covered by reads; colored regions on the figure above), while edges are represented by reads connecting these exons. Next, it identifies a path within the splice graph that has the highest weight (largest number of reads on edges). Such path would correspond to an assembled transcript at this iteration of the algorithm. Because the edge weight is equal to the number of the reads StringTie estimates the coverage level for this transcript (see below) which can be used to estimate the transcript's abundance. Reads that are associated with the transcript that was just assembled are then removed and the graph is updated to perform the next iteration of the algorithm.</p>\n<h2 id=\"transcript-quantification\"><a href=\"#transcript-quantification\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Transcript quantification</h2>\n<p>Transcriptome quantification attempts to estimate expression levels of individuals transcripts.

Tools like Cufflinks and StringTie reconstruct transcripts from spliced read alignments generated by other programs (TopHat, HISAT, STAR), so they already have the information about which reads belong to each reconstructed transcript. Other tools such as <a href=\"http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ckingsf/software/sailfish/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sailfish</a>, <a href=\"http://pachterlab.github.io/kallisto/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kallisto</a>, and <a href=\"http://combine-lab.github.io/salmon/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Salmon</a> perform <em>lightweight</em> alignment of RNAseq reads against existing transcriptome sequences. The goal of lightweight alignment is to quickly distribute the reads across transcripts they likely originate from without worrying too much about producing high quality alignments. The upside of this is that the entire procedure can be performed very quickly. The downside is that these tools require high quality transcriptome as input, which is not a problem if you work with humans or mice, but is a problem if you are studying Hyacinth macaw or any other brilliantly colored creatures.</p>\n<h4 id=\"lightweight-alignment\"><a href=\"#lightweight-alignment\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Lightweight alignment</h4>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ckingsf/software/sailfish/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sailfish</a> has been initially designed to utilize <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-mer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>k</em>-mer</a> matching for finding association between reads and corresponding transcripts:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"/src/tutorials/rb_rnaseq/sailfish.png\"></p>\n<p><strong>Assigning reads to transcripts: Sailfish</strong><br>\nSailfish indexes input transcriptome for a fixed <em>k</em>-mer length and compares <em>k</em>-mers derived from RNAseq reads against this index.

A <em>k</em>-mer from an RNAseq read (green) is looked up in the hash table, which immediately gives its position in the suffix array allowing to extend the march as described in the legend and the <a href=\"http://biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2015/10/22/029652.full.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">paper</a>.

It constructs a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Bruijn_graph\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">De Bruijn graph</a> from transcriptome input (pane <strong>b</strong> of the figure below). This graph is different from De Bruijn graphs used for genome assembly in that its nodes are <em>k</em>-mers and transcripts correspond to paths through the graph. To accommodate multiple transcripts that can lay along the same path (or sub-path) the paths are \"colored\" with each transcript given a distinct \"color\" (in genome assembly the graph is built from the reads and nodes usually correspond to overlaps between <em>k</em>-mers forming incoming and outgoing edges). Non-branching sections of the graph that have identical coloring are \"glued\" into contigs. Finally a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">hash table</a> is built that stores the position of each transcriptome <em>k</em>-mer within the graph:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"/src/tutorials/rb_rnaseq/kallisto.png\"></p>\n<p><strong>Assigning reads to transcripts: Kallisto</strong><br>\nHere a black read is being associated with a set consisting of red, blue, and green transcripts (<strong>a</strong>). First, a graph is built from transcriptome (<strong>b</strong>). Next, by finding common <em>k</em>-mers between the read and the graph the read is \"threaded\" along a path (<strong>c</strong> and <strong>d</strong>). The colors along that path would indicate which transcripts it is likely derived from. Specifically, this is done by taking intersection of \"colors\" (<strong>c</strong>). It this case the read is assigned to two transcripts: red and blue.

Instead it creates <a href=\"https://github.com/lh3/bwa\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bwa</a>-like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FM-index\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">FM-index</a> and uses it to finds chains of <em>Maximal Exact Matches</em> (MEMs) and <em>Super Maximal Exact Matches</em> (SMEMs) between a read and the transcriptome.\n<a href=\"http://biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2015/06/27/021592.full.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Patro:2015</a> define a MEM as \"<em>a substring that is shared by the query (read) and reference (transcript) that cannot be extended in either direction without introducing a mismatch</em>\". Similarly, a SMEM is defined as a \"<em>MEM that is not contained within any other MEM on the query.</em>\" One of the advantages of utilizing the FM-index is that a new index does not need to re-generated for a search with different set of parameters.

Suppose, as shown on the image below, there are three transcripts (green, red, and blue). There are five reads associated with these transcripts. One read (<em>d</em>) is unique to the red transcript, while others correspond to two (<em>b</em>, <em>c</em>, <em>e</em>) or three (<em>a</em>) transcripts. The EM is an iterative procedure. In the first round transcript abundances are initialized as equal (0.33 each as there are three transcripts) and during expectation reads are apportioned across transcripts based on these abundances. Next, during maximization step transcript abundances are re-calculated as follow. For red transcript we sum up fraction of each read as 0.33 + 0 + 0.5 + 1 + 0.5 for reads a, b, c, d, and e, respectively. We now divide this by the sum of read allocations for each transcript as 2.33 + 1.33 + 1.33 for red, green, and blue transcripts respectively. For all three transcript calculation will look like this:</p>\n<div>\n\t$$\n<p>\\color{red}{red}   =  \\frac{0.33 + 0.0 + 0.5 + 1.0 + 0.5}{2.33 + 1.33 + 1.33} = 0.47\\</p>\n<p>\\color{green}{green} =  \\frac{0.33 + 0.5 + 0.0 + 0.0 + 0.5}{2.33 + 1.33 + 1.33} = 0.27\\</p>\n<p>\\color{blue}{blue}  =  \\frac{0.33 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.0 + 0.0}{2.33 + 1.33 + 1.33} = 0.27</p>\n<pre><code>$$\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<p>During next expectation stage read are re-apportioned across transcripts and the procedure is repeated until convergence:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"/src/tutorials/rb_rnaseq/em.png\"></p>\n<p><strong>Expectation Maximization (EM)</strong><br>\nImage from <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1104.3889v2.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pacher:2011</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"understanding-quantification-metrics\"><a href=\"#understanding-quantification-metrics\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Understanding quantification metrics</h3>\n<p>As we've seen above quantification for a transcript is estimated using the number of associated reads.

(<strong>a</strong>) Simple read-counting schemes sum the fragments incident on a gene’s exons. The exon-union model counts reads falling on any of a gene’s exons, whereas the exon-intersection model counts only reads on constitutive exons. (<strong>b</strong>) Both of the exon-union and exon intersection counting schemes may incorrectly estimate a change in expression in genes with multiple isoforms. The true expression is estimated by the sum of the length-normalized isoform read counts. The discrepancy between a change in the union or intersection count and a change in gene expression is driven by a change in the abundance of the isoforms with respect to one another. In the top row, the gene generates the same number of reads in conditions A and B, but in condition B, all of the reads come from the shorter of the two isoforms, and thus the true expression for the gene is higher in condition B. The intersection count scheme underestimates the true change in gene expression, and the union scheme fails to detect the change entirely. In the middle row, the intersection count fails to detect a change driven by a shift in the dominant isoform for the gene. The union scheme detects a shift in the wrong direction. In the bottom row, the gene’s expression is constant, but the isoforms undergo a complete switch between conditions A and B. Both simplified counting schemes register a change in count that does not reflect a change in gene expression. Figure from <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v31/n1/abs/nbt.2450.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Trapnell:2013</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The following discussion of DGE logic is reproduced from <a href=\"http://chagall.med.cornell.edu/RNASEQcourse/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dündar:2015</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To determine the genes whose read count differences between two conditions are greater than expected by chance, DGE tools must make assumptions about the distribution of read counts. The null hypothesis – that the mean read counts of the samples of condition <strong>A</strong> are equal to the mean read counts of the samples of condition <strong>B</strong> – is tested for each gene individually. One of the most popular choices to model the read counts is the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Poisson distribution</a> because:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>individual reads can be interpreted as binary data (Bernoulli trials): they either originate from gene <em>i</em> or not;</li>\n<li>we are trying to model the discrete probability distribution of the number of successes (success = read is present in the sequenced library);</li>\n<li>the pool of possible reads that could be present is large, while the proportion of reads belonging to\ngene <strong>i</strong> is quite small.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The nice feature of a Poisson distribution is that variance = mean. Thus, if the RNA-seq experiment gives us a precise estimate of the mean read counts per condition, we implicitly know what kind of variance to expect for read counts that are not truly changing between two conditions. This, in turn, then allows us to identify those genes that show greater differences between the two conditions than expected by chance. While read counts of the same library preparation (<em>technical replicates</em>) can indeed be well approximated by the Poisson distribution, it has been shown that biological replicates have greater variance (noise) than expected. This <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overdispersion\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">overdispersion</a> can be captured with the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_binomial_distribution\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">negative binomial distribution</a>, which is a more general form of the Poisson distribution that allows the variance to exceed the mean. The square root of the dispersion is the coefficient of variation – SD/mean – after subtracting the variance we expect due to Poisson sampling.</p>\n<p>In contrast to the Poisson distribution, we now need to estimate two parameters from the read counts: the mean as well as the dispersion. The precision of these estimates strongly depends on the number (and variation) of replicates – the more replicates, the better the grasp on the underlying mean expression values of unchanged genes and the variance that is due to biological variation rather than the experimental treatment. For most RNA-seq experiments, only two to three replicates are available, which is not enough for reliable mean and variance estimates. Some tools therefore compensate for the lack of replication by borrowing information across genes with similar expression values and shrink a given gene’s variance towards the regressed values. These fitted values of the mean and dispersion are then used instead of the raw estimates\nto test for differential gene expression.</p>\n<p>The best performing tools tend to be <a href=\"https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/edgeR.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">edgeR</a>, <a href=\"https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DESeq/DESeq2</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/limma.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">limma-voom</a> (see Rapaport et al.

Genes with adjusted <em>p</em>-value &#x3C; 0.1 are in red (there is only one such gene in this sample at the bottom of the graph):</p>\n<p><img src=\"/src/tutorials/rb_rnaseq/MA_plot.png\"></p>\n<p>The Principal Component Analysis (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">PCA</a>) shows the separation between Condition 1 and 2. This type of plot is useful for visualizing the overall effect of experimental covariates and batch effects (each replicate is plotted as an individual data point):</p>\n<p><img src=\"/src/tutorials/rb_rnaseq/pca.png\"></p>\n<p>A heatmap of sample-to-sample distance matrix gives us an overview over similarities and dissimilarities between samples:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/src/tutorials/rb_rnaseq/euc_dist.png\"></p>\n</blockquote>\n"}},"context":{}}
