The following screencast shows how this works:</p>\n<div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9\"><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/120901536?portrait=0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<h2 id=\"ftp-upload\"><a href=\"#ftp-upload\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>FTP upload</h2>\n<p>FTP stands for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">file transfer protocol</a>. This is <strong>the best</strong> way to upload large files (or large number of files) into Galaxy:</p>\n<div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9\"><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/120972739?portrait=0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<h2 id=\"url-upload\"><a href=\"#url-upload\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>URL upload</h2>\n<p>In some cases you may need to upload public datasets from the Internet. These datasets will have web addresses (also called Uniform Resource Locators or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">URLs</a>). A web address of a dataset can be pasted directly into the upload tool interface:</p>\n<div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9\"><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/120973708?portrait=0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<h2 id=\"sra-upload\"><a href=\"#sra-upload\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>SRA upload</h2>\n<p>Finally, if the data you are uploading has been deposited to the Short Read Archive (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SRA</a>) at <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NCBI</a> use the following approach:</p>\n<div class=\"alert alert-warning trim-p\" role=\"alert\">\n<p>Note: SRA approach downloads individual datasets into <a href=\"/tutorials/collections/\">collections</a>. Galaxy uses collections to combine similar datasets in order to streamline interface and minimize the amount of clicking you need to do. Please, take a look a collections <a href=\"/tutorials/collections/\">tutorial</a> to understand this useful concept.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9\"><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/217216264?portrait=0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<h2 id=\"to-gzip-or-not-to-gzip\"><a href=\"#to-gzip-or-not-to-gzip\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>To GZIP or not to GZIP</h2>\n<p>Compressing can be a highly efficient way to store many types of biological data. For example fastq datasets (a typical representation for sequencing reads) can be compressed to approx. 33% of their original size with <code>gzip</code> utility. So if the data you are uploading is already compressed (e.g., has <code>.gz</code> or <code>.bz2</code> file extensions) keep it this way! Upon upload simply tell Galaxy (as shown in FTP upload video) that file(s) is(are) compressed (i.e., of <code>fastqsanger.gz</code> type if this is appropriate). </p>\n"}},"context":{}}
