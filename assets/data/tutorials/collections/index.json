This tool allows you to filter out failed elements so you can continue your analysis instead of performing it again. <strong>Flatten</strong> - squish collection into a simple list of elements. <strong>Filter from File</strong> - given a file of collection element IDs reduce the collection to only a subset of elements listed in the file. <strong>Relabel from File</strong> - use labels in the file to change the collection element names. <strong>Concatenate</strong> - merge two collection tail-to-head.</small></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h1 id=\"using-collections\"><a href=\"#using-collections\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Using collections</h1>\n<p>Earlier in this tutorial we demonstrated what collections are, how they can be created, and manipulated.

The maping step produces another collection as output but this collection is no longer paired (mappers use paired fastq reads to generate a single BAM dataset from each pair). Instead it is a simple list of BAM files. During mapping (see below and also see <a href=\"/tutorials/ngs/#read-groups\">this tutorial</a>) we set read groups within individual BAM datasets. This effectively labels each read with its origin (e.g., we know that read came from, say, <em>sample 1</em>). Because of this we can merge the entire collection of BAM files into a single BAM dataset.
