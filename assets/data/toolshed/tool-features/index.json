A misconception of the Galaxy Tool Shed is that it is a source code repository for developing Galaxy tools. It is not!! If you treat the Tool Shed as a source code repository for your tools while they are in development, you will undoubtedly experience unexpected (and potentially undesirable) behavior.</p>\n<p>The primary intent of the Tool Shed is for sharing functionally correct Galaxy tools, workflows and other useful Galaxy utilities. Galaxy tools are generally developed within a local Galaxy environment, proven to be functionally correct within that environment, and then uploaded to a public Tool Shed for sharing. Local development Tool Sheds may be beneficial components of a Galaxy tool development environment.</p>\n<p>With a couple of exceptions, support for tool features are restricted to the Galaxy framework. The following links refer to pages that describe those exceptions.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/src/toolshed/tools-with-dependencies-in-same-repository/index.md\">Building Tools with Dependencies in the Same Repository</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"/src/toolshed/tools-with-dependencies-in-separate-repositories/index.md\">Building Tools with Dependencies in Separate Repositories</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"/src/toolshed/a-tool-or-a-suite-per-repository/index.md\">Structuring Tools in Your Repository</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"/src/defining-images-in-tool-configs/index.md\">Galaxy Tool Configuration File Help Settings that will Display an Image File Contained in the Repository</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"/src/toolshed/tool-dependency-recipes/index.md\">Recipes for Installing and Compiling Packages Required by Galaxy Tools</a></p>\n"}},"context":{}}
