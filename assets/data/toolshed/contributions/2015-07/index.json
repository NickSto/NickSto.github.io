As part of HISAT, we have developed a new indexing scheme based on the Burrows-Wheeler transform (BWT) and the FM index, called hierarchical indexing, that employs two types of indexes: (1) one global FM index representing the whole genome, and (2) many separate local FM indexes for small regions collectively covering the genome. Our hierarchical index for the human genome (about 3 billion bp) includes ~48,000 local FM indexes, each representing a genomic region of ~64,000bp. As the basis for non-gapped alignment, the FM index is extremely fast with a low memory footprint, as demonstrated by Bowtie. In addition, HISAT provides several alignment strategies specifically designed for mapping different types of RNA-seq reads. All these together, HISAT enables extremely fast and sensitive alignment of reads, in particular those spanning two exons or more. As a result, HISAT is much faster >50 times than TopHat2 with better alignment quality. Although it uses a large number of indexes, the memory requirement of HISAT is still modest, approximately 4.3 GB for human. HISAT uses the Bowtie2 implementation to handle most of the operations on the FM index. In addition to spliced alignment, HISAT handles reads involving indels and supports a paired-end alignment mode. Multiple processor can be used simultaneously to achieve greater alignment speed. HISAT outputs alignments in SAM format, enabling interoperation with a large number of other tools (e.g. SAMtools, GATK) that use SAM. HISAT is distributed under the GPLv3 license, and it runs on the command line under Linux, Mac OS X and Windows.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/devteam/data_manager_build_kraken_database\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">data_manager_build_kraken_database</a>: planemo upload for repository <a href=\"https://github.com/galaxyproject/tools-devteam/blob/master/data_managers/data_manager_build_kraken_database/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://github.com/galaxyproject/tools-devteam/blob/master/data_managers/data_manager_build_kraken_database/</a> commit <a href=\"https://github.com/galaxyproject/tools-devteam/commit/00a7926c285bc4a339bd7deebf40b28f39c7d947\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">00a7926c285bc4a339bd7deebf40b28f39c7d947</a>-dirty Contains a data manager that defines and populates the kraken_databases tool data table.

The UNAFold software package is an integrated collection of programs that simulate folding, hybridization, and melting pathways for one or two single-stranded nucleic acid sequences. The name is derived from \"Unified Nucleic Acid Folding.\" Folding (secondary structure) prediction for single-stranded RNA or DNA combines free energy minimization, partition function calculations and stochastic sampling. For melting simulations, the package computes entire melting profiles, not just melting temperatures. UV absorbance at 260 nm, heat capacity change (C(p)), and mole fractions of different molecular species are computed as a function of temperature. The package installs and runs on all Unix and Linux platforms that we have looked at, including Mac OS X. Images of secondary structures, hybridizations, and dot plots may be computed using common formats. Similarly, a variety of melting profile plots is created when appropriate. These latter plots include experimental results if they are provided. The package is \"command line\" driven. Underlying compiled programs may be used individually, or in special combinations through the use of a variety of Perl scripts. Users are encouraged to create their own scripts to supplement what comes with the package.

The first algorithm is designed for Illumina sequence reads up to 100bp, while the rest two for longer sequences ranged from 70bp to 1Mbp. BWA-MEM and BWA-SW share similar features such as long-read support and split alignment, but BWA-MEM, which is the latest, is generally recommended for high-quality queries as it is faster and more accurate. BWA-MEM also has better performance than BWA-backtrack for 70-100bp Illumina reads. Li H. and Durbin R. (2009) Fast and accurate short read alignment with Burrows-Wheeler Transform.
