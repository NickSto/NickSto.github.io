Using <a href=\"/support/biostar/\">Galaxy Biostars</a> is the best way to get help in most cases. If the problem is more complex, we may ask you to email us a description of the problem and how to reproduce it. To help clarify and aid with troubleshooting: the description may include share links (History, Workflow, Visualization), screenshots, tools involved (name, version), other input data locations/names (example: Data Library contents), and the URL of the public server you are working at.</p>\n<p>If using your own <a href=\"https://galaxyproject.github.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">local/docker/cloud Galaxy server</a>, details about the Galaxy Version, server OS/version, advanced configurations applied, whether the server is new or not, and if the behavior changed after making admin changes (tool installs, upgrading). See <strong>Administrative problems</strong> below.</p>\n<h3 id=\"administrative-problems\"><a href=\"#administrative-problems\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Administrative problems</h3>\n<p>If the problem is presenting in your own Galaxy, administrative configuration may be a factor. <strong>For the fastest help directly from the development community</strong>, admin issues can be alternatively reported to the galaxy-dev@lists.galaxyproject.org mailing list or the GalaxyProject Gitter channel <a href=\"https://gitter.im/galaxyproject/Lobby\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://gitter.im/galaxyproject/Lobby</a>.

This includes input and output datasets used in the analysis thread leading up to the problem. Red error datasets are not applied to your account's usage quota.
