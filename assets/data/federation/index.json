These include free public servers, virtual machines, cloud instances,\nusegalaxy.* federation, container images, etc. However, such dedicated installations of Galaxy instances\nis gradually leading to many silos of data, shared objects, tools, and expertise. In order to further\nstrengthen the community and help build on each other's contributions, we are actively working\non the notion of resource federation for Galaxy. This means that it will be possible to bring together\ndisparate data and compute resources to effectively handle large data and long computations.</p>\n<p>For end users, this means that they will be able to bring their own resources to an existing Galaxy instance\nto expand the available storage and compute capacity for their jobs. For resource owners, it will be\npossible to partner with other institutions to bring existing resources to an otherwise managed Galaxy\ninstance. Contributed resources can be added to the shared pool or isolated for specific user(s). While\nthis is a long-term, multi-year effort, we have been and are continuing to work toward these goals. Below\nare some links and references about the ongoing progress. Feel free to reach out and join.</p>\n<h2 id=\"compute\"><a href=\"#compute\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Compute</h2>\n<p>Aggregating compute resources from a variety of sources is necessary step toward Galaxy federation.\nWe have been actively working on a software stack to provider the necessary abstractions and hooks\nso that a variety of resources, from cloud machines to supercomputers, can be added into the available\nresource pool. Much work remains but the gist of it can be seen on <a href=\"http://cloudve.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http://cloudve.org</a> website.</p>\n<h2 id=\"storage\"><a href=\"#storage\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Storage</h2>\n<p>Expanding the storage available to a Galaxy account is a critical piece of infrastructure required to enable\nlarge analyses. The ultimate idea is to be able to seamlessly link external data repositories and object stores\nwhile the data is automatically retrieved by Galaxy. In the meantime, starting with Galaxy 19.01, it is possible\nto easily retrieve private data from an AWS S3 bucket as well as send it back. A first significant step in eluding\nthe storage quotas.</p>\n<h2 id=\"authentication-and-authorization\"><a href=\"#authentication-and-authorization\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Authentication and Authorization</h2>\n<p>Acquiring a variety of resources from different providers and owners requires a significant investment into\nauthentication and authorization aspects.
