In\nthis beta4 release, we would like to announce availability of a data browser,\nproject-level isolation, and availability of the latest release of Galaxy.</p>\n<h1 id=\"gvl-data-browser\"><a href=\"#gvl-data-browser\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>GVL data browser</h1>\n<p>Starting with the beta3 release of the GVL, there was a notion of shared\nstorage between different applications and across GVL projects that enables\nusers to easily access the same data between those applications. Namely, each\nGVL project comes with a project-scoped data folder that is available in the\navailable applications, mounted under <em>/gvl/projects/current/</em>. For example, a\nfile formatted in the Terminal is immediately visible in RStudio under the same\npath and can be readily visualized and ingested for analyses. Additionally,\neach GVL comes with a folder that is shared across all projects, available at\n<em>/gvl/public</em>. Any file placed in this directory will be simultaneously\navailable in any project on the given GVL instance.</p>\n<p>For the beta4 release we have added a visual data browser that allows users to\nupload and navigate around their GVL data from anywhere. Based on\n<a href=\"https://nextcloud.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NextCloud</a>, a user can access their GVL data using a\nweb browser, a desktop app, or a mobile app. Data can be organized into folders\nusing drag-and-drop, text files can be previewed, and even mounted as an\nexternal drive on the user’s local laptop to interact with it as if it was a\nlocal folder. Think of the GVL as your data repository in the cloud.</p>\n<div class=\"center\">\n    <a href=\"/blog/2020-07-gvl5-beta4/gvl-data-browser.png\">\n        <img src=\"./gvl-data-browser.png\" width=\"60%\" />\n    </a>\n</div>\n<p>The data browser also provides the ability to connect buckets from AWS S3 or\nOpenStack and make them available within the GVL. Once a user attaches a bucket\nas external storage, data can be copied from the bucket into one of the folders\navailable to the GVL applications. Similarly, any data generated on the GVL can\nbe copied or moved to a bucket for persistence and further sharing. The\nscreenshot below captures the contents of an S3 bucket viewed through the AWS\nweb console and the content of that same bucket linked to a GVL instance.</p>\n<div class=\"center\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2em\">\n    <a href=\"/blog/2020-07-gvl5-beta4/gvl-s3-mount.png\">\n        <img src=\"./gvl-s3-mount.png\" width=\"100%\" />\n    </a>\n</div>\n<p>Finally, the project folders available on the GVL are automatically backed up\nto the respective cloud provider’s object storage service. In the case of AWS,\nan S3 bucket is created for a GVL and any data uploaded or generated on the GVL\nis synchronized to that bucket using the same folder structure as what is\ncreated on the GVL. Just like the GVL, these backups work for AWS, OpenStack,\nand GCP clouds. The backups provide a new level of redundancy for the GVLs that\nminimize chances for data loss or corruption as well as enable service recovery\nin case the GVL servers are unexpectedly lost.</p>\n<h1 id=\"project-level-isolation\"><a href=\"#project-level-isolation\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Project-level isolation</h1>\n<p>With the introduction of GVL projects in the previous release the vision for a\nhosted GVL that caters to different needs of users while minimizing\ninfrastructure management overhead came one big step closer to reality.\nHowever, the initial implementation provided no isolation between projects for\nusers - any user could access any project. For single-user Galaxy instances or\nprivate group instances this was not sufficient. While more work remains to\nensure proper service isolation, an initial implementation is now available\nthat restricts user access to projects. Managed through Keycloak roles, when a\nnew project is created, a new GVL user is also created that is the sole user\nauthorized to access the newly created projects. Additional users can be added\nby an admin via the Keycloak web console. When a user logs in, they now see\nonly the projects that are available to them and can switch between them from\nthe CloudMan console. However, it is also possible to easily collaborate\nbetween multiple projects that users have access to. Projects can share data\nbetween each other using the public shared folder, or by mounting the project’s\ndata into another project, provided the user has permissions.</p>\n<h1 id=\"update-to-latest-galaxy-2005\"><a href=\"#update-to-latest-galaxy-2005\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Update to latest Galaxy: 20.05</h1>\n<p>A new version of Galaxy was recently announced, <a href=\"https://galaxyproject.org/news/2020-06-galaxy-release-20-05/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">release\n20.05</a>.
