We have been making hourly\nrequests to instances which have listed themselves in one of the public Galaxy\nserver lists to request non-sensitive information about their configuration.</p>\n<p>E.g. what \"brand\" do they have configured, how many allow users to purge\ndatasets, how many have quotas enabled.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://stats.galaxyproject.eu/dashboard-solo/snapshot/7pgA1b2OcA0UBteiMx1h5bPlwh7Kzv95?orgId=1&#x26;panelId=11\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"img-fluid mx-auto\" src=\"/src/blog/2017-10-public-galaxy-dashboard/dashboard-details.png\" alt=\"Public Galaxy Server Dashboard\" /></a></p>\n<h2 id=\"dashboards\"><a href=\"#dashboards\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Dashboards</h2>\n<p>All of this data is collected together into some nice dashboards on the <a href=\"http://www.bioinf.uni-freiburg.de/Galaxy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Freiburg Galaxy</a>'s\n<a href=\"https://stats.galaxyproject.eu/dashboard/db/public-galaxy-servers?orgId=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">public Grafana instance</a>\nYou'll find the answers to these questions and more in our tables and graphs</p>\n<p>Now that we've started collecting this data we will be able to answer questions\nwhich have long plagued the development team such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How often do people upgrade?</li>\n<li>How soon after a release do they upgrade? Do they upgrade immediately or do they wait?</li>\n<li>Which releases are people running? Recent ones? Or ones that are no longer supported?</li>\n<li>Which features do admins enable? Which do the community find important?</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"uptime\"><a href=\"#uptime\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Uptime</h2>\n<p><em>But wait! There's more.</em> As part of this monitoring we realised that we could\ntrivially calculate uptimes based on how often servers have failed to respond\nto us whenever we pinged them. So we've produced some uptime badges for you to\nuse and brag about your instance to your bosses / colleagues / etc. If you ever\nneeded someone else's stamp of approval that you're doing a good job, here it is.\nWay to go Galaxy admins!

We have\nimproved the heuristics over time, and our script only checks in once an hour,\nso it won't catch anything happening in the other 59 minutes of every hour.\nAnd if your server is protected by an external authentication mechanism then\nthis does not detect the server ever being up.\nIf you think your server is marked offline in error, please let us know and\nwe'll look into it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"open-data-open-code\"><a href=\"#open-data-open-code\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Open Data, Open Code</h2>\n<p>The code that collects this data is <a href=\"https://github.com/martenson/public-galaxy-servers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">freely available</a> under the <a href=\"https://github.com/martenson/public-galaxy-servers/blob/master/LICENSE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MIT\nlicense</a>.\nThe tool produces some <code>.json</code> files containing the results of talking to every\nGalaxy, and we've made that\n<a href=\"https://stats.galaxyproject.eu/raw/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">available</a> under CC0.
