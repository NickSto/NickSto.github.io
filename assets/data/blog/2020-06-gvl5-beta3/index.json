class=\"body-wrapper col-md-9\">\n<p>We are happy to announce the latest release of the Genomics Virtual Lab (GVL),\nbeta3, that brings two new major features:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Isolated projects, and</li>\n<li>Multiple applications.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1 id=\"gvl-projects\"><a href=\"#gvl-projects\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>GVL projects</h1>\n<p>Traditionally, the GVL has provided a mechanism for users to obtain\nready-access to a production-grade Galaxy installation on the cloud in a\nself-serve model. In that model, users would launch their own instance, first\nneeding to obtain access to a cloud provider, procure cloud credentials,\nnavigate the launch process, and then maintain the launched instance in the\nlong term. The GVL 5.0 release aims to relieve the user from that burden by\nproviding a platform on which managed GVL deployments can be made available by\ngroups and institutions. With a managed GVL, researchers simply <em>start</em> a\nGalaxy instance, as opposed to <em>launching</em> it. The difference between <em>start</em>\nand <em>launch</em> is that the managed GVL can provide the cloud resources and the\nmanagement software as already running services where users simply claim access\nto a new Galaxy instance, running in an isolated containerized environment, and\ndo not need to provide their own resources or cloud credentials. In many ways\nit is similar to how *usegalaxy.** servers provide access to a ready-to-use\nGalaxy. With the GVL, the goal is to provide a similar service of\neasy-to-access Galaxy but for private Galaxy instances.</p>\n<p>As a step in this direction, the beta3 release of the GVL 5.0 series introduces\nthe notion of <em>projects</em>. A project is a virtual separation of the environment\nin which Galaxy runs. Projects allow multiple Galaxy instances to run\nsimultaneously on the same underlying resources while each instance is\ncompletely separate. With this capability, individual users or different groups\ncan obtain a Galaxy instance by simply requesting a new GVL project, without\nproviding cloud credentials or managing the cloud infrastructure. A GVL\nadministrator creates a new project and grants the user access. Each Galaxy\ninstance has its own database, data, and users, separated at the infrastructure\nlevel. This provides isolation and flexibility where different Galaxy instances\ncan run differentiated toolsets, be supported by different cloud allocations,\nor be made available to targeted users.</p>\n<div class=\"center\">\n    <a href=\"/blog/2020-06-gvl5-beta3/gvl-projects.png\">\n        <img src=\"./gvl-projects.png\" width=\"80%\" />\n    </a>\n</div>\n<p>While a managed deployment of the GVL that anyone can access and request their\nGalaxy instance is still an endeavor for the future, the GVL projects are now\navailable on latest GVL instances launched via CloudLaunch. In turn, the\nproject feature caters to the classroom or workshop training use cases where\nindividual participants can have access to their own Galaxy instance,\nregardless if they are <em>using Galaxy</em> or <em>administering Galaxy</em>.</p>\n<h1 id=\"support-for-multiple-applications\"><a href=\"#support-for-multiple-applications\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Support for multiple applications</h1>\n<p>In addition to the production installation of Galaxy, the GVL now offers users\naccess to Jupyter, RStudio, and a web-based Terminal within any GVL project. A\nGVL administrator has an option to add applications at-will via Helm Charts.\nThis multi-application environment significantly expands the capabilities for\ndata analysis with the GVL. Researchers can seamlessly switch between these\napplications and work in an environment most suitable for the task at hand:\ninteractive Python scripts are within reach in a Jupyter notebook allowing\nusers to mix code, figures, and text; some 1,500\n<a href=\"https://www.bioconductor.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bioconductor</a> packages are available for\ninstallation in RStudio; and one-off scripts can be developed in the Terminal.\nMeanwhile, Galaxy remains as a graphical interface to workflows and well-known\ntools with extensive sharing capabilities. As a user, you have unrestricted\naccess to those applications and can install any additional packages within\nthose applications that are needed for the analysis.</p>\n<div class=\"center\">\n    <a href=\"/blog/2020-06-gvl5-beta3/gvl-login.png\">\n        <img src=\"./gvl-apps.png\" width=\"80%\" />\n    </a>\n</div>\n<p>Having access to multiple applications on the same platform needs to be\ncomplemented with the ability to easily exchange data between those\napplications. In turn, each GVL project comes with a project-scoped data folder\nthat is available in any of the available applications, mounted under\n<em>/gvl/projects/current/</em>. For example, a file formatted in the Terminal is\nimmediately visible in RStudio and can be readily visualized and ingested for\nanalyses. Similarly, the shared folder can be made available in a Galaxy data\nlibrary, although not automatically yet, and subsequently imported into a\nHistory for analysis. The directory being consistent across apps and projects,\nensures the portability of scripts expecting files at that path.</p>\n<p>To further facilitate classroom or workshop usage scenarios, each GVL comes\nwith a folder that is shared across all projects, mounted at <em>/gvl/public</em>. Any\nfile placed in this directory will be simultaneously available in any GVL\nproject. This folder provides a medium to share common inputs and training\nmaterials, or final results as outcomes from a lecture.</p>\n<h1 id=\"use-these-gvl-features\"><a href=\"#use-these-gvl-features\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Use these GVL features</h1>\n<p>To get started with these features, launch the latest release of the GVL on\nyour choice of cloud provider using\n<a href=\"https://launch.usegalaxy.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CloudLaunch</a>. After the server starts up (~12\nminutes on AWS), Galaxy will automatically start and be available at the link\nprovided. To start Jupyter, RStudio, or Terminal, click the <em>Add Application</em>\nbutton on the CloudMan dashboard and select which application you’d like to\nadd. In a few moments, a link to the selected application will become available\nand the application will be ready for use about a minute later.</p>\n<p>As with the recent GVL releases\n(<a href=\"https://galaxyproject.org/blog/2020-02-gvl5-beta\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Feb</a>,\n<a href=\"https://galaxyproject.org/blog/2020-04-gvl5-beta2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Apr</a>), we are still in beta\nbut we are approaching the end of adding new features. We will then transition\nto improving robustness of the applications as well as write documentation. In\nthe meantime, please take the GVL for a test drive and <a href=\"https://gitter.im/galaxyproject/FederatedGalaxy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">let us\nknow</a> how it feels. <strong>If you\nhave a good use case that makes use of the multiple applications now available,\nplease reach out to the authors.</strong> We’d love to work with you to support the\nuse case, test the platform, and ideally write a paper describing the new\ncapabilities.</p>\n</div>\n"}},"context":{}}
