In addition, the fixes have been backported to\nolder releases.</p>\n<p>The Galaxy Committers would like to thank David Wyde for disclosing these\nvulnerabilities. Details follow:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The vulnerable tools are “Filter GFF data by attribute” and “Filter GFF data\nby feature count”, both of which are provided with and enabled by default in\nthe Galaxy server. These two tools share code with each other and the more\ngeneral “Filter data on any column using simple expressions” tool. The\nlatter was fixed in a previous security disclosure but these GFF variants of\nthe tool were missed when updating the Filter tool. These tools use the\nPython eval and exec functions and do not properly sanitize input to these\nfunctions. The fix for this issue has been applied to Galaxy releases back\nto v14.10 and can be found in Commit c1e3087</li>\n<li>An uploaded file’s name was not properly sanitized, and so a specially\ncrafted filename uploaded to the Galaxy server could be used as an XSS\nattack vector. The fix for this issue has been applied to Galaxy releases\nback to v16.07 and can be found in Pull Request 3278.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"highlights\"><a href=\"#highlights\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a><a href=\"https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/releases/16.10_announce.html#highlights\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Highlights</a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Galaxu UI plugins - Webhooks:</strong> We introduce Galaxy Webhooks - optional plugins for the web UI that allow for better customization of your instance. See the documentation. Includes work from @bgruening, @anatskiy, and Joachim Wolff @joachimwolff.</li>\n<li><strong>Workflow run form replaced:</strong> The workflow run form has been replaced by one backed by the new tool form and the API. Nicer, faster, standardized.</li>\n<li><strong>Automatic tool reload after installation:</strong> Galaxy does not need to be restarted after tool installation anymore. This provides a smoother experience for the users. Yay! Thanks to @mvdbeek.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"get-galaxy\"><a href=\"#get-galaxy\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a><a href=\"http://getgalaxy.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Get Galaxy</a></h2>\n<p>The code lives at <a href=\"https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Github</a> and you should have <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Git</a> to obtain it.</p>\n<p><strong>To get a new Galaxy repository run:</strong>\n<code>console $ git clone -b release_16.10 https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy.git</code></p>\n<p><strong>To update an existing Galaxy repository run:</strong>\n<code>console $ git checkout release_16.10 &#x26;&#x26; git pull --ff-only origin release_16.10</code></p>\n<h2 id=\"release-notes\"><a href=\"#release-notes\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a><a href=\"https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/releases/16.10_announce.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Release Notes</a></h2>\n<p>For full details on all of the enhancements and fixes in this release, please see the <a href=\"https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/releases/16.10_announce.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">full release notes</a>.</p>\n<br />\nOn behalf of the [Galaxy Committers](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/blob/dev/doc/source/project/organization.rst), ***Thanks for using Galaxy!***\n"}},"context":{}}
