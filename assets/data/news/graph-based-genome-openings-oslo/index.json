Graphs can represent variation between individuals and thus allows a better representation of the full hereditary material of a species (or several related species).\nExtending the Galaxy system with functionality to allow users to construct, share and perform analyses on graph representations could make such enhanced representations available to a broad audience.</p>\n<p>The positions are embedded within the HyperBrowser environment, which includes seven researchers and programmers working primarily on the development of genome analysis functionality, as well as around thirty more loosely coupled collaborators.
