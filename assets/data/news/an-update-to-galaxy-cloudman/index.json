Any new cluster will automatically use this version. Existing clusters will have a link displayed at the top of the CloudMan console offering to perform an automated update.</p>\n<p>The new version brings the following updates/features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Added ability to specify a path where Galaxy is installed as part of user data (using <code>galaxy_home</code> key). This allows custom Galaxy application to be installed and picked up by CloudMan instead of the default one. This works across cluster invocations as well as for shared clusters. For a complete list of user data options see <a href=\"/admin/Cloud/UserData/\">Admin/Cloud/UserData</a></li>\n<li>Use <code>/etc/profile</code> instead of <code>/etc/bash.bashrc</code> for system wide shell logins</li>\n<li>Support for 3.0 Kernel on Ubuntu 11.10 for SGE. Contributed by Brad Chapman.</li>\n<li>Fix for SGE install after cloud-init has run and changed <code>/etc/hosts</code></li>\n<li><code>post_start_service</code> now runs if the script exists in the cluster bucket even if no URL was provided as part of current user data</li>\n<li>Fix recognition of existing and attached file system volumes on instance reboot</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"/people/enis-afgan/\">EnisAfgan</a></p>\n"}},"context":{}}
