Hopefully having a well defined topic will allow us to\naccomplish a lot and let people who don't have particular tasks in\nmind find something to work on very quickly.</p>\n<p>We have been collecting ideas to work on here -\n<a href=\"https://github.com/galaxyproject/tools-iuc/issues/239\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://github.com/galaxyproject/tools-iuc/issues/239</a>, but we expect\nto attract the most participation by simply getting tool developers\ninterested in getting help adding collection support to their existing\ntools and workflows to show up and participate.</p>\n<p>If you are interested in participating in the hackathon but not\ninterested in actual tool development - we will assemble a list of\nsmaller, manageable Python and JavaScript tasks to work on and\ncertainly documentation is a chronically lacking for collections so we\ncould use help there and no actual coding would be required.</p>\n<p>This is the first remote hackathon we have organized and we encourage\nideas or advice about how to organize it please let us know. We are\ncurrently thinking a two day event in which a core group of us would\nbe available on IRC all day and we would have 4 google hangouts across\nthose days to organize, answer questions, and report progress. We are\nalso currently thinking September 17th and 18th.</p>\n<p>Thanks, <br />\nGalaxy IUC</p>\n"}},"context":{}}
