The workflow report\neditor is easier than ever to use providing you with a list of common\nreport components, interactive interfaces for embedding them in your\nreports, and a new workflow invocation tracker. You can now embed\nvisualizations directly in your workflow reports making summarizing your\nanalyses easier than ever. And, once your reports are produced, you can\nexport them directly to pages to share your reports with colleagues.</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TmZzfaKf1V0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p>If you're building advanced workflows utilizing Galaxy's powerful\nsub-workflows for reusable workflow components, then you'll be pleased\nto know you can now automatically update those to the latest version</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2gHvmy_tIVc\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p>Furthermore when you're making workflows to share with others, a new\n\"Best Practices\" checker has been included which helps you discover easy\nthings which make your workflows more shareable.</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pfNqAkzvKj8\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<h2 id=\"remote-files\"><a href=\"#remote-files\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Remote Files</h2>\n<p>There was tough competition for top feature to highlight from 21.01 but\nthe <strong>Remote Files</strong> interface is an absolutely fantastic new way to\nbrowse your data. Inside Galaxy there is a new, abstract way to\nreference files locally and on other servers. This let us provide a\nuniform interface to FTP servers, your Dropbox, public S3 buckets, and\nmore! You'll find this under <em>Choose Remote Files</em> in the upload\ninterface.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/latest/_images/21.01-remote.png\">\n<em>Screenshot of the remote files\nbrowser in the upload dialog. It lists several popular datasets such as\nPDB the protein data bank, EBI's FTP server, Genome Ark, and 1000\nGenomes among others.</em></p>\n<p>The Galaxy Climate community is providing an excellent test case; much\nof their data is publicly available on public S3 buckets which were not\neasy to access, now they're directly available from Galaxy. No more\nmagic \"import this url\" steps in your documentation, now \"just browse\nthe repository for your data\".</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/latest/_images/21.01-remote-weather.png\">\n<em>Screenshot of the remote files browser in the upload dialog. Here climate datasets are\nhighlighted such as Sentinel, Copernicus, and NOAA's public datasets. At\nthe bottom is the user's FTP directory.</em></p>\n<p>But the addition of the Remote Files browser didn't stop there! Several\nother interfaces received updates to use this new framework:</p>\n<h2 id=\"history-import--export\"><a href=\"#history-import--export\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>History Import &#x26; Export</h2>\n<p>Histories can now be exported directly to your FTP folders, Dropbox, or\nany other configured remote file storage.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/latest/_images/21.01-hist-exp.png\">\n<em>Screenshot of \"Export\nhistory archive\" interface showing the new \"to a remote file\" option\nwith the user's FTP directory selected and foo.tar.gz entered as an\nexample filename</em></p>\n<p>And history importing saw the same treatment, permitting importing from\nany of these public data locations making it easier than ever to share\nhistories between Galaxy, and make your analyses more reproducible!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/latest/_images/21.01-hist-imp.png\">\n<em>Screenshot of \"Import history from archive\" interface which now includes an option to \"Select\na remote file\" which provides access to the remote file interface.</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"rule-builder\"><a href=\"#rule-builder\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Rule Builder</h2>\n<p>Likewise the Rule-Builder now has access to the remote files interface.\nSample sheets with identifiers can easily be found in many FTP servers\nand other locations, and then loaded directly into the Rule Builder via\nthis new interface. So easy!</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta-history-panel\"><a href=\"#beta-history-panel\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Beta History Panel</h2>\n<p>The History panel is getting a refresh and a huge performance boost in\nthe latest code. Does this sound exciting to you? Try it out now with\nthe history menu option \"Use Beta History Panel\". This is not its final\nstate but we'd love feedback from you, the users, on how you find it. It\nfeatures both performance and usability improvements. E.g. now you can\nrename files without going into a separate menu, just double click the\ndataset title!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/latest/_images/21.01-beta-hist.png\"></p>\n<p><em>Beta history screenshot with a history titled \"The Beta History\", a few datasets and\ncollections, and a textbox shown where the dataset title is being edited\ndirectly.</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"user-friendliness-improvements\"><a href=\"#user-friendliness-improvements\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>User-friendliness Improvements</h2>\n<p>This is a new section covering smaller improvements that just make your\nlife easier and your interactions with Galaxy faster.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Interactive tools can be stopped, without their outputs\ndisappearing, better for reproducibility!</li>\n<li>When uploading files, the 'name' field will be auto-focused,\nallowing you to get straight to renaming the files, saving you time.</li>\n<li>Workflow versions now expose their update time. Reverting to an old\nversion? Oh, yes, that one from Tuesday!</li>\n<li>Sharing components now include a \"copy to clipboard\" feature for\nURLs. One click and you're ready to share with the world.</li>\n<li>The GTN-in-Galaxy overlay now keeps track of the page you were\nlooking at if the Galaxy page gets refreshed.
