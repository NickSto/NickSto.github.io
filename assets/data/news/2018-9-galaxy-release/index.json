There were also a number of usability enhancements including better\nlabeling, links, overhauled workflow import interfaces, and many more.</p>\n<h2 id=\"group-tags\"><a href=\"#group-tags\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Group Tags</h2>\n<p>Galaxy now contains powerful new features for multiple factor analysis of\ncollections of datasets. The concept of group tags has been added to Galaxy.\nThese are a special class of tags that describe key-value pairs that can be\nattached to the contents of a collection during upload or using collection\noperation tools. These tags can describe multiple sets of variables for the\ncontents of a collection. Once set, these tags can be consumed intelligently by\ntools that need to divide collections into multiple overlapping factors or sets\nof datasets. A special thanks to @mvdbeek for devising and implementing this\napproach.</p>\n<h2 id=\"python-3-beta-support\"><a href=\"#python-3-beta-support\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Python 3 Beta Support</h2>\n<p>After almost 3 years of work and more than 100 pull requests, we are proud to\nannounce the Beta-stage support for running Galaxy under Python 3. Lint, unit,\nAPI, framework, integration and Selenium tests all pass, time for you to give\nit a try and report any bug you find!</p>\n<p>Please see the <a href=\"https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/release_18.09/releases/18.09_announce.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">full release\nnotes</a>\nfor more information, including how to upgrade today!</p>\n<p><em>Thanks for using Galaxy!</em></p>\n</div>\n"}},"context":{}}
