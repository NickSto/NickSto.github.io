Even though the conference was virtual, I am really glad to have interacted with fellow young researchers from around the world, broadening my perspectives in the process. By far, my best part of #biodata20 was meeting one-on-one with four incredible genomics and data science researchers, courtesy of being a JXTX scholarship awardee. Although the mentorship sessions lasted only 30 minutes, I felt like I had been blessed with career and life-long mentors. All the mentors left the door open for further guidance, advice and perhaps even future collaboration. Having presented a <a href=\"https://meetings.cshl.edu/posters/data20/images/viewer.html?file=data_20_170.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">poster</a> at the conference, I have also benefitted from continued discussions about my research via the meeting slack workspace. Overall, the #biodata20 meeting is one of the best things that have happened to me in a challenging 2020. I would like to thank my supervisors, colleagues, JXTX mentors and above all the JXTX Foundation for making this experience possible. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p>Please help further the careers of junior researchers by considering make a contribution to <a href=\"/src/jxtx/foundation/index.md\">JXTX: The James P.
