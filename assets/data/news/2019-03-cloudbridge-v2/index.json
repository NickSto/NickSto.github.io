CloudBridge ensures operational consistency across the supported providers allowing the same code to run consistently across multiple cloud providers. With this release, CloudBridge supports Amazon Web Service (AWS), Microsoft Azure, OpenStack, and now Goodle cloud. This release is further characterized by improved code consistency.</p>\n<p>Key features of this release are as follows:</p>\n<h3 id=\"support-for-google-cloud-platform-gcp\"><a href=\"#support-for-google-cloud-platform-gcp\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Support for Google Cloud Platform (GCP)</h3>\n<p>With an extensive help Google, the Google Cloud Platform now has complete implementation of all the CloudBridge capabilities. If you have any CloudBridge code available, this mean it is now possible to readily leverage GCP without code changes! For the Galaxy and CloudLaunch projects, this means it will soon be possible to launch containerized instances of Galaxy on GCP.</p>\n<h3 id=\"introduction-of-library-middleware\"><a href=\"#introduction-of-library-middleware\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Introduction of library middleware</h3>\n<p>A new middleware layer has been added to CloudBridge that can listen and intercept events. This makes it possible to extend CloudBridge without touching the library source code.\nTake a look at the documentation for details on how to use this feature: <a href=\"http://cloudbridge.cloudve.org/en/latest/topics/event_system.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http://cloudbridge.cloudve.org/en/latest/topics/event_system.html</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"interface-changes\"><a href=\"#interface-changes\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Interface changes</h3>\n<p>In the process of adding the 4th cloud provider, it was necessary to create some new abstractions to keep the library functionality as consistent as possible. With that, some backwards incomaptible interface changes took place. Namelt, providers now operate in a specific zone and hence zone parameter is no longer accepted by methods. Also, the package layout has been simplied by moving all the modules one level higher in the hierarchy.</p>\n<p>Overall, much of the code has been made significantly more streamlined with simpler interfaces. For other features and changes contained in this release, please take a look at the <a href=\"https://github.com/CloudVE/cloudbridge/blob/master/CHANGELOG.rst\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CHANGELOG</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"availability\"><a href=\"#availability\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Availability</h2>\n<p>Latest version of CloudBridge is available from PyPi (<a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/cloudbridge/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://pypi.org/project/cloudbridge/</a>) for installation via pip (<code>pip install cloudbridge</code>) or <a href=\"https://github.com/CloudVE/cloudbridge/releases\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">download from GitHub</a>.
