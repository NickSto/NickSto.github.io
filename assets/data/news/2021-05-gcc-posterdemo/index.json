They are an excellent way to more fully present, discuss, and demonstrate your work.  The <strong><a href=\"https://www.vibconferences.be/events/gcc2021-virtual-edition\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Galaxy Community Conference (GCC2021)</a></strong> is using Remo as our conference platform and this has many advantages for presenting your work:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Each poster/demo will be assigned its own named table in the Poster/Demo building,</li>\n<li>Up to 8 people can interact at each poster/demo table simultaneously.</li>\n<li>The Remo platform encourages video, audio, and chat interaction within tables.</li>\n<li>People will be able to see if someone is at a table to answer questions, before they join the table.</li>\n<li>Posters are not limited to just one big PDF.  In fact we don't even require that format.  Remo tables each have a whiteboard, where you can post PDFs, links, videos, images, and even live drawing.</li>\n<li>You can also share your screen with others at your table.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Poster/Demo abstract submission is open through June 14.</strong>  Abstracts are limited to 1750 characters.  Conference registration closes June 25.  Early registration ends June 8.</p>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary\" style=\"font-size: x-large; font-weight: 600;\">\n<p><a href=\"https://www.vibconferences.be/events/gcc2021-virtual-edition#abstracts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Submit a Poster/Demo Abstract</a></p>\n</button>\n</div>\n"}},"context":{}}
