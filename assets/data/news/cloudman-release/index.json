Existing clusters will be given an option to do an automatic update once the main interface page is refreshed. Note that this upgrade is a major version upgrade and thus the migration is rather complicated. The migration process has been automated but will take a little while to complete. If you have made customizations to your cluster in terms of adding file systems, upgrading the database, or similar, we do not recommend you perform the upgrade. Note that this upgrade comes with (and requires) a new AMI (ami-118bfc78), which will automatically be used when starting an instance via <a href=\"http://usegalaxy.org/cloudlaunch\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CloudLaunch</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>This update brings a large number of updates and new features, the most prominent ones being:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unification of <code>galaxyTools</code> and <code>galaxyData</code> file systems into a single <code>galaxy</code> filesystem. This change makes it possible to utilize the <a href=\"/toolshed/\">Galaxy Tool Shed</a> when installing tools into Galaxy.</li>\n<li>Added initial support for Hadoop-type workloads</li>\n<li>Added initial support for cluster federation via HTCondor</li>\n<li>Added a new file system service for an instance's transient storage, allowing it to be used across the cluster over NFS</li>\n<li>Added a service for the Galaxy Reports webapp</li>\n<li>Added optional <a href=\"http://loggly.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Loggly</a> based off-site logging support</li>\n<li>Added tags to all resources utilized by CloudMan</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more details on the new features, see the the <a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/galaxy/cloudman/src/tip/CHANGELOG.md?at=default\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CHANGELOG</a> and for even more details see, <em>all <a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/galaxy/cloudman/commits/all?search=35baec1%3A8bbae3f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">291 commit messages</a> from 7 contributors</em>.</p>\n<p>Enjoy and please let us know what you think,</p>\n<p><a href=\"/people/enis-afgan/\">Enis Afgan</a></p>\n"}},"context":{}}
