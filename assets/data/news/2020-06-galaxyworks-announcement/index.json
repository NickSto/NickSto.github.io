Our goal is to\nbroaden the reach of Galaxy into new sectors by simplifying access to the\nGalaxy software and providing enterprise-level services. Simplifying access to\nGalaxy will allow users to focus on extracting value from data rather than\nmanaging Galaxy.</p>\n<p>GalaxyWorks provides Galaxy Pro, a product offering for commercial\norganizations looking to use Galaxy for data analysis. <strong>Galaxy Pro</strong> is a\nmanaged version of Galaxy in the cloud with capabilities that public Galaxy\nservers do not plan to support, such as improved project- and customer-specific\nprivacy, security enhancements, and greater resource capabilities. In addition,\nGalaxy Pro comes with professional services and support. Galaxy Pro comes with\na validated set of tools and workflows as well as customization services to\npromote customer success. Galaxy Pro is available via subscription.</p>\n<p>GalaxyWorks builds upon the existing Galaxy code base by advocating adoption of\nGalaxy in the commercial space and creating new markets and users for Galaxy.\nGalaxyWorks will be contributing software products developed through the\ncompany back to the open-source community and provide help and support to all\nGalaxy users. <em>We are absolutely committed to helping maintain and grow the\nGalaxy open source community.</em></p>\n<p>In summary:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Galaxy</strong>: the open-source, academic software, free servers, and a\nworld-wide community; the Galaxy you know is unaffected and will continue to\ngrow.</li>\n<li><strong>Galaxy Pro</strong>: a managed version of Galaxy in the cloud with capabilities\nthat public Galaxy servers do not plan to support, such as improved privacy,\nsecurity enhancements, and resource capabilities as well as professional\nservices and support.

GalaxyWorks will improve adoption of\nthe Galaxy platform in new segments by offering users a managed, commercial\nservice that frees them from maintaining infrastructure and tools. By providing\na unified service that allows a user to focus on analyzing the data without the\nneed to manage the Galaxy server, GalaxyWorks will provide an important service\nfor the broader Galaxy community.</p>\n<h1 id=\"who-is-galaxyworks\"><a href=\"#who-is-galaxyworks\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Who is GalaxyWorks?</h1>\n<p>The  company was formed by several members of the Galaxy team and community:\nEnis Afgan, Dannon Baker, Dan Blankenberg, John Chilton, Nate Coraor, Jeremy\nGoecks, Nuwan Goonasekera, Aysam Guerler, Anton Nekrutenko, Stephanie Pond, and\nthe late James Taylor. In the future, we will explore options for interested\nmembers of the Galaxy community to join as well.
