The aims of the CZI EOSS program are to support software\nmaintenance, growth, development, and community engagement for critical tools\nin biomedical research. We are delighted for Galaxy to join this fantastic\nprogram. This project has been awarded to the Oregon Health &#x26; Sciences\nUniversity, Johns Hopkins University, and the University of Melbourne. While\nthese three institutions have been working together to develop features for\nGalaxy to function better in distributed and cloud computing environments for\nseveral years, this CZI grant formalizes this collaboration for the first time,\nenabling better coordinated efforts.</p>\n<p>In this project, we will (1) extend Galaxy to allow easy browsing and importing\nof datasets from large data repositories; (2) enable Galaxy to efficiently use\ncloud computing resources for large-scale, near-data computing; and (3) extend\nGalaxy integration with other data science environments. These new Galaxy\nfeatures will allow researchers to easily view and fetch data from Google\nstorage and the CZI <a href=\"https://www.humancellatlas.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Human Cell Atlas</a> and\nbring it into Galaxy, making it straightforward to ingest shared data. New\nfunctionality in the Kubernetes-based deployment of Galaxy will enable\nutilization of remote object data storage directly, skipping the need for a\nshared file system and improving performance. Lastly, we will enable the\n<a href=\"https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/release_19.09/admin/special_topics/interactivetools.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Interactive\nTools</a>,\nstarting with Jupyter, to operate on the Kubernetes deployment of Galaxy,\nmaking this a portable, robust method of deploying ITs for Galaxy anywhere.</p>\n<p>We are delighted to commence this project in the coming weeks and welcome input\nand contributions from the Galaxy community. The software development in this\nproject will help solidify the Kubernetes-based version of Galaxy as a\nfull-featured, robust solution  for deploying  a production-quality, scalable\nversion of Galaxy on any computing platform, from laptop to computing cluster\nto a commercial computing cloud.</p>\n"}},"context":{}}
