The successful candidate will work at the interface between an in-house deep-sequencing facility (HiSeq-2500) and the various research groups at the institute. Main responsibilities include</p>\n<ul>\n<li>primary analysis of deep-sequencing data and quality controls</li>\n<li>maintenance and extension of existing analysis pipelines</li>\n<li>data and software management for the Bioinformatics Group</li>\n<li>training and consulting</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Most of the above tasks are executed within the context of our Galaxy platform that will have to be administrated and further developed. There will be ample opportunities for direct collaborations with research groups and methodological developments.</p>\n<p>See the <a href=\"https://depot.galaxyproject.org/hub/attachments/news/bioinformatician-freiburg2014/FreiburgJobPosting.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">full job posting</a> for further details.</p>\n<hr>\n<div class='right'><a href='http://www.bioinf.uni-freiburg.de//?en'><img src=\"/images/logos/bioinf_uni_freiburg.png\" alt=\"Bioinformatics Uni-Freiburg\" width=\"100\" /></a></div>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bioinf.uni-freiburg.de//?en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Bioinformatics group</a> in Freiburg, Germany recruiting creative and motivated PhD students, postdoctoral\nscholars or software engineers with a strong interest in RNA and NGS\nrelated bioinformatics. PhD students will work in one of our research\nprojects and get an insight into RNA-Bioinformatics and NGS, while\npostdocs will have the opportunity to furthermore define their own\nresearch agenda.</p>\n<p>Our lab has two main research areas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Galaxy project, which is an open, web-based platform to support\ncomputational biomedical research. We are integrating new tools as well\nas interactive visualizations into Galaxy and working closely together\nwith Galaxy community. Besides our strong NGS focus we are also driving\nthe development of a cheminformatic Galaxy workbench. This project is\nhighly community- and cooperation driven, with partners from industry\nand academic.</li>\n<li>RNA research, which includes local sequence-structure and multiple\nalignment of RNA, RNA folding, energy landscapes for RNA and also\nprotein design and protein-protein Interactions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Candidates should have a background in one or more of the following\nareas: genomics, computer science, visualization, or bioinformatics. A\nstrong interest in programming and software development is as crucial as\nbeing passioned to solve scientific problems.\nOur lab is located in Freiburg, a beautiful university city in the south\nwest of Germany with the Black Forest, France and Switzerland just\naround the corner and excellent research facilities all over the city.</p>\n<p>Please contact <a href=\"/people/bjoern-gruening/\">Bjoern Gruening</a> for further details.</p>\n"}},"context":{}}
