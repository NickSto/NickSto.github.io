Students will work on their own laptops and have continued access to software and example data used in the exercises through our public <a href=\"http://bioinformatics.ucdavis.edu/software/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Web Services virtual machine</a>. The first three bootcamps will use the Galaxy platform, and the final bootcamp will use both Galaxy and the command-line. The Alignment and Assembly bootcamps (Dec. 11th &#x26; 12th) require you to know Galaxy, so if you are unfamiliar with Galaxy, you should also take the Introduction bootcamp on Dec. 10th.</p>\n<p><strong>Tuesday, December 10:</strong>\n<strong><a href=\"http://training.bioinformatics.ucdavis.edu/2013/10/16/bootcamp-introduction-to-next-generation-sequence-analysis-with-galaxy-december-10-2013/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Introduction to Next-Generation Sequence Analysis with Galaxy</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Wednesday, December 11:</strong>\n<strong><a href=\"http://training.bioinformatics.ucdavis.edu/2013/10/16/bootcamp-next-generation-sequence-alignment-and-variant-discovery-december-11-2013/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Next-Generation Sequence Alignment and Variant Discovery</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Thursday, December 12:</strong>\n<strong><a href=\"http://training.bioinformatics.ucdavis.edu/2013/10/16/bootcamp-genome-assembly-using-next-generation-sequence-data-december-12-2013/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Genome Assembly using Next-Generation Sequence Data</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Friday, December 13:</strong>\n<strong><a href=\"http://training.bioinformatics.ucdavis.edu/2013/10/16/bootcamp-introduction-to-the-amazon-cloud-for-galaxy-and-the-command-line-december-13-2013/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Introduction to the Amazon Cloud for Galaxy and the Command-Line</a></strong></p>\n<p>Daily instruction will run from 9am until 5pm.
