Unlike video tutorials, these will not become stale and are truly interactive (allowing users to actually navigate and interact with Galaxy). Galaxy 16.01 ships with two example tours and new ones can easily be added by creating a small YAML file describing the tour. Try the Galaxy UI tour on Main.</p>\n<p><strong>Wheels</strong></p>\n<p>Galaxyâ€™s Python dependencies have traditionally been distributed as eggs using custom dependency management code to enable Galaxy to distribute binary dependencies (enabling quick downloads and minimal system requirements). With this release all of that infrastructure has been replaced with a modern Python infrastructure based on pip and wheels. Work done as part of this to enable binary dependencies on Linux has been included with the recently released pip 8.</p>\n<p>Detailed documentation on these changes and their impact under a variety of Galaxy deployment scenarios can be found in the Galaxy Framework Dependencies section of the Admin documentation.</p>\n<p><strong>Nested Workflows</strong></p>\n<p>Workflows may now run other workflows as a single abstract step in the parent workflow. This allows for reusing or subworkflows in your analyses.</p>\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td style=\" border: none;\"> <span style=\"font-size: larger;\"> Github </span> <br /><br /><strong>New</strong><br /><code>% git clone -b master https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy.git</code><br /><br />U<strong>pdate to latest stable release</strong><br /><code>% git checkout master && pull --ff-only origin master</code><br /><br /><strong>Update to exact version</strong><br /><code>% git checkout v16.01</code> </td>\n    <td style=\" vertical-align: top; border: none; width: 10%;\"> </td>\n    <td style=\" vertical-align: top; border: none;\"> <span style=\"font-size: larger;\"> BitBucket </span> <br /><br /><strong>Upgrade</strong><br /><code>% hg pull</code><br /><code>% hg update latest_16.01</code> </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td colspan=3 style=\" border: none;\"> See the <a href=\"/admin/get-galaxy/\">Get Galaxy</a> page for additional details regarding the source code locations. </td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: larger;\"> Deprecation Notices </span></p>\n<p>Barring a strong outcry from deployers, 16.01 will be the last release of Galaxy to support Python 2.6.
