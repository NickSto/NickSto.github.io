It is available at\n<a href=\"https://launch.usegalaxy.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://launch.usegalaxy.org/</a>.</p>\n<p>The new launcher has a large number of new features, some of the most\nnotable ones are summarized here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Native multi-cloud support</strong>: built on\n<a href=\"http://cloudbridge.cloudve.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CloudBridge</a>, this implementation of\nCloudLaunch has native support for multiple cloud providers, paving a path for\nusing Galaxy on any of those clouds in a consistent, robust fashion. At the\nmoment, this includes Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and OpenStack.\nSupport for the Google Compute Engine is forthcoming.</li>\n<li><strong>A catalog of applications</strong>: Just like multple clouds, it is now possible to\nbrowse a catalog of applications (think Galaxy flavors each tailored for a\nspecific type of analysis) and launch them in a consistent fashion on the\nsupported cloud providers.</li>\n<li><strong>Credentials management</strong>: Recall searching your inbox or a text file\nsomewhere for those access and secret keys to be able to copy them into the\nappropriate fields before launching your instances? The new CloudLaunch allows\nyou to store your credentials right there and simply choose which credentials\nyou'd like to use for a given launch. The keys are stored in encrypted\nfields in the database and can only be read by the server process. Keep in\nmind that for security reasons, we will periodically expire (i.e., delete) all\nstored keys so make sure to keep a copy and do not rely on the CloudLaunch\nserver as a persistent key store.</li>\n<li><strong>Deployment management capabilities</strong>: After you have launched your\napplication, the new CloudLaunch will perform periodic health checks making\nsure the application is still active and report that status on the\n<em>My appliances</em> page. You also have the option to delete a deployment\nright from CloudLaunch.</li>\n<li><strong>REST API</strong>: last but not least - the new CloudLaunch is 100% driven with a\nREST API. This allows you to build on top of it and integrate available\nfeatures into your own application or extend the existing capabilities. It\nalso has a command-line client: <a href=\"https://github.com/CloudVE/cloudlaunch-cli\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://github.com/CloudVE/cloudlaunch-cli</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are just a few most visible features available. There are many more\nlurking under the hood (e.g., ability to add your own applications with a\ncompletely custom UI) so go ahead and explore, use it, and let us know where it\nfalls short.</p>\n<p>This new CloudLaunch application replaces the old launcher whose life began in\n2011 but the technological evolution prompted for a more flexible solution going\nforward. The old launcher will still be available at\n<a href=\"https://old.launch.usegalaxy.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://old.launch.usegalaxy.org</a>.</p>\n<p>Happy launching!</p>\n"}},"context":{}}
