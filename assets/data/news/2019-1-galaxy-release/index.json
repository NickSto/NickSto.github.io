That progress continues in release 19.01.</p>\n<p>The workflow editor now features explicit step parameter nodes for non-file data (integers,\nstrings, booleans, etc) and the ability to connect these to all tool inputs - not just files.\nThe YAML-based Galaxy Format 2 workflow language is now included in Galaxy as a beta option\nand allows import and export of human readable workflows as well as extensions to allow Galaxy\nto serve as a file editor for such workflows. The workflow editor features\nmore helpful labels on inputs and outputs and important fixes including\nlogic for connecting collections and dealing with missing tools. The workflow run form now deals with default\nvalues more correctly.</p>\n<h2 id=\"enhanced-support-for-singularity\"><a href=\"#enhanced-support-for-singularity\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Enhanced Support for Singularity</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://singularity.lbl.gov/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Singularity</a> container support in Galaxy has been brought to\nparity with Docker container support. Specifically, Galaxy can now be configured to fetch\n<a href=\"https://biocontainers.pro/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Biocontainers</a> automatically for enabled job destinations.\nMoreover, explicitly annotated Docker containers (either in tools or job destinations) can be used\nwith Singularity.
