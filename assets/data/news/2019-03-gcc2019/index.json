The <em>tenth</em> <a href=\"/src/gcc/index.md\">GCC</a> will have many familiar features from earlier years, including accepted and lightning talks, posters and demos, birds-of-a-feather gatherings (BoFs), training, and a CollaborationFest.  2019 also brings the <a href=\"https://gcc2019.sched.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">most significant conference program update</a> in several years:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>some training will be integrated with the main conference,</li>\n<li>three days of conference instead of two,</li>\n<li>several parallel sessions,</li>\n<li>and a strong emphasis on organizing content by domain.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>GCC2019, like every GCC before it, will be built around <em>community</em>.  Training topics are nominated, selected, and presented by the community.  Presentations will  feature the full spectrum of Galaxy applications, enhancements and deployments from the community as well.</p>\n<p>If you are working in data intensive life science research then there will not be a better place to share your work, learn from others, and find new collaborators.</p>\n<p><strong>Registration</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"/src/events/gcc2019/registration/index.md\">Early registration</a> starts at €49/day for students and postdocs, and €79 / day for other academics and non-profit researchers.  Early registration ends 17 May, <em>when rates go up by 60%. So, <a href=\"/src/events/gcc2019/registration/index.md\">register early</a>.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Present your work!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"/src/events/gcc2019/abstracts/index.md\">Abstract submission</a> for talks, lightning talks, demos and posters is now open.  If you work in data-intensive life science (or in other fields using Galaxy) then please consider presenting your work at GCC2019.  This is an ideal chance to present to 200+ researchers, all addressing common challenges in data intensive science.  Review of oral presentations starts on 22 April, in a little over a month.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"/src/events/gcc2019/abstracts/index.md\">Submit an abstract (or two) now</a>!</strong></p>\n<p><em>We hope to see you in Freiburg!</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"/src/events/gcc2019/organizers/index.md\">GCC2019 Organizers</a></p>\n"}},"context":{}}
