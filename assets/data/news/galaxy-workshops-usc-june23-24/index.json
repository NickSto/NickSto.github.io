Both are presented by Jeremy Goecks of Emory University and the Galaxy team.  Both workshops are open to the public:\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://uschsl.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_bDaxnZwEfrfk1BG\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Galaxy: A web‐based workbench for interactive and reproducible analysis of high‐throughput sequencing data</a>, Thursday, June 23, 2011</strong>\nAt Aresty Auditorium, Harylene J Norris Cancer Research Tower, USC Health Science Campus, 1450 Biggy Street.  <a href=\"https://uschsl.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_bDaxnZwEfrfk1BG\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Registration is free, but required.</a>\n9:15am-Noon\n<em>Introduction to Galaxy including 30 min.

Galaxy is one approach for addressing these problems. <a href=\"http://usegalaxy.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Galaxy</a> is a popular Web-based platform for performing accessible, reproducible, and transparent genomics research. Galaxy provides a collaborative environment for performing complex analyses with automatic and unobtrusive provenance tracking; these features allow transparent sharing of both the precise computational details underlying an analysis and also intent, context, and narrative. Based on experiences with Galaxy, Jeremy will discuss some open problems that might be addressed using artificial intelligence methods and techniques.</p>\n"}},"context":{}}
