You'll also learn how to extend your Galaxy with your own tools and tools from the community, and how to define reference data in your server as well.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"/src/events/admin-training2016/advanced-session/index.md\">Advanced Session: November 9-11</a></strong></p>\n<p>The three day <a href=\"/src/events/admin-training2016/advanced-session/index.md\">advanced session</a> will build on topics covered in the <a href=\"/src/events/admin-training2016/basics-session/index.md\">basics section</a>.
