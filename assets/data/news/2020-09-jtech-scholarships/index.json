Taylor</a>, the Ralph S. O’Connor Professor at the Departments of Biology and Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University said and lived by. This, he believed, was imperative to advance science, and in a way that facilitated diversity and inclusion. The mission of this foundation is to continue his legacy, through a multifaceted approach which will be unrolled across several stages.</p>\n<p><strong>Please consider <a href=\"https://give.communityfunded.com/o/eberly/i/eberly-college-of-science/s/jtech#CommunityI39hubL9i\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">making a donation</a> to support James Taylor’s legacy.</strong></p>\n"}},"context":{}}
