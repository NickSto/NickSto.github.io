Over the following years,\nled by <a href=\"https://www.melbournebioinformatics.org.au/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Melbourne Bioinformatics</a>,\nthe Genomics Virtual Laboratory (GVL) was developed as a cloud-based platform\nfor bioinformatics. In addition to Galaxy, the GVL made a suite of tools\navailable on the same system creating a bioinformtics data analysis workbench.</p>\n<p>Starting with the Galaxy 17.09 release, we have merged the two solutions for\ngaining easy access to Galaxy-on-the-Cloud. Going forward, when wanting to use\nGalaxy on a cloud provider, please launch the\n<a href=\"https://launch.usegalaxy.org/catalog/appliance/genomics-virtual-lab\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Genomics Virtual Lab appliance</a>\nfrom <a href=\"https://launch.usegalaxy.org/catalog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CloudLaunch</a>.</p>\n<p>The GVL comes with all the same functionality as the standalone Galaxy CloudMan\ndid including easy setup, cluster scaling, Galaxy admin user management, etc.\nIn addition, each launched GVL comes with the following application services:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A dedicated Jupyter Notebook server</li>\n<li>A dedicated RStudio server</li>\n<li>Remote desktop access (via browser)</li>\n<li>An upload folder for easier data sharing</li>\n<li>A dashboard for managing all running services</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We are excited about this development because it helps make data analysis\nmore accessible, more comprehensive, and brings more people together.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://launch.usegalaxy.org/catalog/appliance/genomics-virtual-lab\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Give it a try</a>\nand <a href=\"https://github.com/galaxyproject/cloudlaunch/issues/new\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">let us know</a> if\nyou have any comments or suggestions.</p>\n"}},"context":{}}
