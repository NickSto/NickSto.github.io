A particular emphasis is in the integration of mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics data with other types of ‘omics’ data for applications in proteogenomics and metaproteomics. The researcher will join a successful team of developers, collaborators and users who have developed the Galaxy for proteomics (Galaxy-P) platform (see <a href=\"http://usegalaxyp.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">usegalaxyp.org</a> and <a href=\"http://z.umn.edu/galaxypreferences\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">references</a>).</p>\n<p>A Ph.D. in bioinformatics, computer science, analytical chemistry or closely related field is required. Experience with MS-based proteomics data analysis is highly preferred, and familiarity with the Galaxy framework is a plus.</p>\n<p>Interested applicants can apply directly to <a href=\"mailto:tgriffin@umn.edu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dr. Tim Griffin</a>.</p>\n"}},"context":{}}
