I have always focused on the science and technical aspects of my gateway. The Bootcamp taught me that to reach financial sustainability I need to think of the gateway operations as a business, which was very foreign to me. Learning about value propositions, budgeting, and marketing were all new areas, but I see now that they are as important to the success of my gateway as a well-designed back end is.”*\n<p>Mark Perri\nAssociate Professor of Chemistry\nSonoma State University</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This opportunity is offered by the Science Gateways Community Institute.
