The GTN aims to make it easy to find Galaxy trainers, and to share and discover the wealth of training resources available for Galaxy.  This includes training materials, a trainer directory, best practices, and guidance on computing platforms for teaching with Galaxy.  The Galaxy Training Network is accessible to the entire community.</p>\n<p>If you teach with Galaxy, then please consider adding your organization, materials, and best practices. The Trainer Directory already includes 16 organizations and there may be one (or 6!) near you.</p>\n<p>Thanks,</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://training.galaxyproject.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Galaxy Training Network (GTN)</a></p>\n"}},"context":{}}
