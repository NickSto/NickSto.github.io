The <a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/groups/galaxy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">library</a> lists published articles, conference proceedings, theses, book chapters and books that use, extend, reference or implement Galaxy. You can <a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/groups/1732893/galaxy/items\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">search the library at Zotero</a>, or through the <a href=\"/search/\">unified Galaxy search</a> (results are in the <em>Corpus</em> tab - <em>but not yet</em> - give Google a few days to catch up).</p>\n<p>Publications are tagged with the same <a href=\"/publication-library/#tags\">set of 17 tags</a> we've been using for years.  However, there are lots of other changes in tagging.  First, those 17 tags now all start with \"+\" to distinguish them from the new server and content tags.</p>\n<p><strong>Highlighted Pubs</strong></p>\n<p>Two tags were added to highlight pubs that particularly focus on Galaxy.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Tag</th>\n<th>Explanation</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong><a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/groups/galaxy/items/tag/+Galactic/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">+Galactic</a></strong></td>\n<td>Publication is about Galaxy.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong><a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/groups/galaxy/items/tag/+Stellar/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">+Stellar</a></strong></td>\n<td>Publication features Galaxy prominently.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Public Server Tags</strong></p>\n<p>Starting with the papers added this month (over 100 of them): Publications that mention or use a <a href=\"/use/\">public Galaxy server</a> or <a href=\"/use/\">service</a> are tagged with the server's name, preceded by a \">\".  For example, the <a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/groups/1732893/galaxy/tags/%3ERepeatExplorer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">>RepeatExplorer</a> tag lists all papers that use or reference the RepeatExplorer public server.</p>\n<p><strong>Content / domain tags</strong></p>\n<p>Also starting with papers added this month, we are including tags provided by publishers about the publication's contents.  These tags are not preceded with a \"+\" or \">\" and they aren't rationalized in any way. They come straight from the publishers.</p>\n<p><strong>Want to help?</strong></p>\n<p>Finally, Zotero is a community platform.
