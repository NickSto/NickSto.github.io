The Celery workers\nare currently not required, but if activated can perform certain\nlong-running tasks, such as creating history export archives. Celery\ntasks will bridge the gap between rapid requests that can be handled\nduring a web request and jobs that require extensive and relatively slow\nsetup.</p>\n<h2 id=\"more-robust-selection-of-job-handlers\"><a href=\"#more-robust-selection-of-job-handlers\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>More robust selection of job handlers</h2>\n<p>Job throughput can be increased by starting Galaxy with multiple\nexternal job handler processes. Jobs were traditionally assigned to a\njob handler process by the web handler or workflow handler process that\ncreated the job. Since Release 19.01 Galaxy has supported additional\nmechanisms that use database serialization techniques to let job\nhandlers assign processes to themselves. This mechanism is more robust\nand doesn't require that all job handler processes be alive and known by\nthe web handler process. Galaxy now determines the best method for\nassigning jobs based on the database in use, if the assignment method is\nnot set explicitly. Older job assignment methods will be removed in\nGalaxy release 21.09. For more details see the <a href=\"https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/release_21.05/admin/scaling.html#job-handler-assignment-methods\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Job Handler Assignment\nMethods\nsection</a>\nof the Galaxy documentation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"¡galaxy-ahora-en-español\"><a href=\"#%C2%A1galaxy-ahora-en-espa%C3%B1ol\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>¡Galaxy, ahora en español!</h2>\n<p>Thanks to Wendi Bacon, the Spanish language translation of Galaxy has been finalised\nand merged, so if you prefer to use Galaxy in Spanish, now you can! This\nupdate will be part of an ongoing project from Spanish speakers within\nthe Galaxy community to keep the Galaxy interface localisation up to\ndate, and to produce some Spanish language training materials in the\nGTN.</p>\n<p><img src=\"images/21.05-espanol.png\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"bugfixes-and-stability\"><a href=\"#bugfixes-and-stability\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Bugfixes and Stability</h2>\n<p>This release of Galaxy features fewer user-facing changes, as a huge amount of\ndeveloper time went into making this a maintenance release with better testing,\nbetter stability, and more bugfixes. But watch out, this is all in preparation\nfor the next release of Galaxy, 21.09, which will have some of the biggest UI\nchanges in years!</p>\n<h2 id=\"remote-files-ftp-support\"><a href=\"#remote-files-ftp-support\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Remote Files: FTP Support</h2>\n<p>In the last release, the Remote Files interface was added granting access to a\nhuge number of remote data sources directly in Galaxy. Support was added for\nFTP servers in the latest release so now you can connect e.g. the NCBI FTP\nserver for all of your genomic data needs.</p>\n<p>##Download Collections from Reports##\nWorkflow reports are gaining popularity and features!
