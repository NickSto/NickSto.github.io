Moving online presents many challenges, but also offers opportunities for making this event more accessible and affordable than an in-person event.  GCC2021 is embracing those opportunities and we are pleased to announce </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>GCC2021 events will be held twice each day</strong>, once in their original Ghent time zone (GCC EMEA/APO), and again 8 hours later in the Americas (GCC Americas).</li>\n<li><strong>Registration rates will be a fraction of the cost of an in person event</strong>, and will include a significant discount for students and researchers based in low and lower-middle income countries.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>GCC2021 will be accessible and affordable in every country and time zone.</strong></p>\n<h3 id=\"training\"><a href=\"#training\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Training</h3>\n<p>Training will be offered from 28 June through 2 July, the week before the conference.
