Meeting with field-leaders as mentors was such a valuable experience that provided me with a diversity of guidance and perspectives that is profoundly influencing my research and professional development as I finish up my PhD work in microbiology and plan my transition into postdoctoral research in computational biology. Mentors, presenters and fellow poster-presenters and attendees were all so welcoming and engaging that conversations are continuing weeks after the meeting itself and giving rise to interactions that I suspect will last years and even careers. The critical support and preparation I received from the JXTX committee fostered these lasting relationships. I am so thankful to have received this award that came with not only financial support, but an entire community.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p>Please help further the careers of junior researchers by making a contribution to <a href=\"/src/jxtx/foundation/index.md\">JXTX: The James P.
