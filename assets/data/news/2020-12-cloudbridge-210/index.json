This removes the dependency on a static machine type list, and returns up-to-date information on instance type availability.</li>\n<li>The default package no longer bundles Azure, as the Azure python libraries are very large and affects docker container size when using cloudbridge. To install with Azure, use pip install cloudbridge[full] or pip install cloudbridge[azure].</li>\n<li>A convenience method for cloning providers in different zones has been added, which helps with multi-zone operations.</li>\n<li>Support for specifying s3 signature version for the AWS provider.</li>\n<li>Miscellaneous bug fixes and error handling improvements.</li>\n<li>Support for python&#x3C;3 dropped.</li>\n<li>No major backward incompatible changes (apart from Azure not being bundled by default)</li>\n</ul>\n"}},"context":{}}
