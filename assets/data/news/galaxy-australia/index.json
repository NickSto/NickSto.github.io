Australian Galaxy users and administrators will now have more opportunities to interact and collaborate to identify and address the needs of the local community. The community will also be a hub for Australian Galaxy training courses and offer a catalog of Australian Galaxy servers.</p>\n<p>The establishment of Galaxy Australia is supported by the <a href=\"https://www.embl-abr.org.au/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">EMBL Australia Bioinformatics Resource (EMBL-ABR)</a> in its appointed role of supporting the development of skills and training in the Australian life science research community. At the EMBL-ABR Hub, hosted at the Victorian Life Sciences Computation Initiative (VLSCI), Galaxy is used extensively for teaching and data analysis directly as well as through the Australian-made <a href=\"https://www.genome.edu.au/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Genomics Virtual Laboratory</a>. VLSCI’s expert bioinformaticians and professional staff will help promote community activities and training.</p>\n<div class='right'>\n<a href='https://twitter.com/galaxyaustralia'><img src=\"/images/logos/TwitterBird300.png\" alt=\"@GalaxyAustralia\" height=\"40\" /></a> \n</div>\n<p>Galaxy Australia has a has a Twitter feed (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/galaxyaustralia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">@GalaxyAustralia</a>) for announcements and discussion relevant to the community.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.embl-abr.org.au/game2017\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Galaxy Australasia Meeting 2017 (GAMe 2017)</a></strong></p>\n<div class='left'>\n<a href='https://www.embl-abr.org.au/game2017'><img src=\"/images/logos/GAMeLogo200.png\" alt=\"Galaxy Australasia Meeting (GAMe 2017)\" width=\"100\" /></a>\n</div>\n<p>The Community’s first major activity is to organise the Galaxy Australasia Meeting 2017 (GAMe 2017), 3-9 February in Melbourne.</p>\n<p>We are pleased to announce that <a href=\"https://www.embl-abr.org.au/game2017/registration/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">early registration</a> and <a href=\"https://www.embl-abr.org.au/game2017/submit-your-talkposter/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">talk and poster abstract submission</a> are now open for GAMe 2017.
