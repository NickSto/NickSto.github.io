It is an excellent venue for sharing your work and learning how others are addressing challenges in data-intensive science.  The Training Week and CoFest will run around-the-clock, and the meeting content will be offered twice daily, 9 hours apart.  <em>Geography will not be a barrier to participating in GCC2021.</em></p>\n<p>But GCC2021 is only an excellent opportunity if you are able to participate.  <em>These fellowships ensure that cost will also not be a barrier to participating.</em></p>\n<p>Fellowship applications are open until May 17.  If you are a student or post-doc working in data-intensive science then you are strongly encouraged to apply.  The application is brief.</p>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary\" style=\"font-size: x-large; font-weight: 600;\">\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd8UMYn276Y92M1I7Sqxh4gCjBkGlSkCCSrEhawY3yb54I1Uw/viewform\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Apply now</a></p>\n</button>\n<br /><br />\n</div>\n<p><em>Note: These fellowships are in addition to the <a href=\"/src/news/2021-04-gcc-fellowships/index.md\">conference fellowships offered by the Galaxy Community Fund Board</a>.
