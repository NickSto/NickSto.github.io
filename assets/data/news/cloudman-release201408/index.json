CloudMan offers an easy way to get a personal and completely functional instance of Galaxy in the cloud in just a few minutes, without any manual configuration.</p>\n<p>This is mostly an incremental bug fix release with the following summary of changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>On AWS, updated galaxyFS snapshot (snap-e6e1c04a), which includes the June 2, 2014 Galaxy release with the July 30th security fix. All the tools installed via the Tool Shed have been updated and a number of new tools added, most notably: Tophat2, Bowtie2, FastQC, several FASTQ manipulation tools, several QC tools.</li>\n<li>For AWS, added support for VPC</li>\n<li>For <a href=\"http://www.openstack.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">OpenStack</a> clouds, added the ability to automatically recover worker instances on cluster reboot</li>\n<li>Added support for creating a file system based on a downloadable archive</li>\n<li>Do not run Galaxy with multiple processes by default. This is because Tool Shed installs do not work properly in the multi-process mode. This feature can be enabled by setting user data option <code>configure_multiple_galaxy_processes</code> to <code>True</code> when launching an instance.</li>\n<li>Set SGE slots in each queue to be equal to the number of cores on the instance</li>\n<li>Set instance IP in the Galaxy's FTP data upload tool message</li>\n<li>Added support for Nginx v1.4 and allow it (with the PAM module) to used as the authentication mechanism when accessing Galaxy Reports app</li>\n<li>Fixed cluster deletion when performed via the API</li>\n<li>No longer automatically start Hadoop and HTCondor services</li>\n<li>On manually-invoked instance reboots, do not increment the instance reboot count that otherwise eventually leads to instance termination</li>\n<li>Limit the size of the log message buffer used in the UI to 1000 lines. Long-running instances had issues with this log growing large and that led to poor UI performance. The complete log is still available from the Admin page (or the command line).</li>\n<li>Automatically delete the bucket/container for Test type (<em>i.e</em>, 'SGE only') clusters on cluster termination</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For complete details on implemented changes, please see the <a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/galaxy/cloudman/commits/all?search=835%3A903\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">source code commits</a>.</p>\n<p>Enjoy and please let us know what you think,</p>\n<p><a href=\"/people/enis-afgan/\">Enis</a> &#x26; <a href=\"/people/dannon-baker/\">Dannon</a> &#x26; <a href=\"/galaxy-team/\">The Galaxy Team</a></p>\n"}},"context":{}}
