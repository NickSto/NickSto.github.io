Our online meetups are around an hour long and feature a presentation followed by an open discussion.  It's a great place to catch up on what your fellow admins are thinking about.</p>\n<p><strong>But, before we start meeting next year, <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfv257YcdQQO7gp3K4USoBzqkd-UDEblsto5UhU34gFlXTiPQ/viewform\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">we need to know what you care about</a>.</strong>  What do you want to learn?  Who do you want to hear from?  What's causing you trouble?

But then, Dave saw something shiny, and then, a while later, he heard <a href=\"/people/helena-rasche/\">Helena</a> calling, as if from a great distance, saying \"I want those GalaxyAdmins meetups again.\"  And so <em>they are back</em>, with Helena leading us fearlessly into the future.<sup>*</sup></p>\n<p><br /><br /></p>\n<p><sup>*</sup> This is all approximately true.</p>\n</div>\n"}},"context":{}}
