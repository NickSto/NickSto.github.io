We'll also have a talk on the <a href=\"https://training.galaxyproject.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Galaxy Training Network</a>, and if 2020 is anything like previous years (it will be), numerous other Galaxy-related presentations from the Galaxy Community. </p>\n<p>We will add everything we know about, as we find about it, to the <a href=\"/src/events/2020-pag/index.md\">Galaxy @ Pag page</a>.
