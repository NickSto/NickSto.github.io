If so, please consider putting a *[Powered by Galaxy](/src/outreach/powered-by-galaxy/index.md)* icon on your websites, presentations and posters.  Increasing Galaxy's visibility has many benefits:\n<ol>\n<li>People can't use Galaxy unless they know about it. It's a sinking feeling to get the results of your first run from the sequencing center and then not know how to exploit that data.</li>\n<li>Increased visibility leads to increased adoption of Galaxy and that leads to more people contributing back to the project.</li>\n<li>Increased adoption and development of Galaxy helps the project with funding.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This, along with [Citing Galaxy](/src/Citing Galaxy/index.md), are two easy things that can be done to increase the visibility of Galaxy.</p>\n<p>Thanks,</p>\n<p><a href=\"/people/dave-clements/\">Dave Clements</a></p>\n"}},"context":{}}
