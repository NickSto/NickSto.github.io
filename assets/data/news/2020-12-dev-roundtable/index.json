Several parts of the Galaxy ecosystem have become avowedly and obviously community driven during that time, including tools, code, training, and several other international efforts.  <strong>It is past time to push this global model to other areas of Galaxy as well.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>At the <a href=\"/events/2020-12-10-dev-roundtable/\">December 10 Galaxy Developer Roundtable</a> we will introduce <em>Galaxy Working Groups</em> as a means for the community to help manage <em>and contribute to</em> key parts of the Galaxy ecosystem.</strong></p>\n<p>If you are interested and are potentially willing to contribute some of your time and effort to helping the global Galaxy effort, then please attend this roundtable on December 10.  If you can't make it, the gathering will be recorded and published shortly after the event.</p>\n<h2 id=\"initial-set-of-working-groups\"><a href=\"#initial-set-of-working-groups\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Initial set of Working Groups</h2>\n<p>The initial proposal includes these topic areas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Backend</strong>: APIs, core framework, performance</li>\n<li><strong>Deployment</strong>: Ansible, K8s, cloud</li>\n<li><strong>Outreach/training</strong>: GTN, content, events</li>\n<li><strong>Scientific applications</strong>: using Galaxy, publications</li>\n<li><strong>Testing and hardening</strong>: release and deployment testing</li>\n<li><strong>Tools</strong>: wrapping, installation, and maintenance</li>\n<li><strong>UI/UX</strong>: scale, accessibility, consistency</li>\n<li><strong>User support and documentation</strong>: help, Hub, user &#x26; dev docs</li>\n<li>** Usegalaxy.* **: running services, synchronization</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thanks, and hope to see you on December 10,<br />\nBjörn Grüning and Anton Nekrutenko</p>\n</div>\n"}},"context":{}}
