Each instance of the GVL can be dynamically scaled via CloudMan and customized with additional tools or reference data. There are also no storage or job quotas.</p>\n<p>Key features of this release are as follows:</p>\n<h3 id=\"upgrade-galaxy-to-1805\"><a href=\"#upgrade-galaxy-to-1805\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Upgrade Galaxy to 18.05</h3>\n<p>GVL 4.4.0 has been updated to include <a href=\"https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/release_18.05/releases/18.05_announce.html#highlights\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Galaxy 18.05</a> with all the features this version of Galaxy brings, including Unlimited Browser Upload Size and the New Powerful Rule-Based Data Uploader. This update also includes the new Galaxy functionality where rich output files from tools need to be whitelisted to have them show formatted content (e.g, HTML). Do this via the Galaxy Admin console.</p>\n<h3 id=\"overridable-galaxy-configs\"><a href=\"#overridable-galaxy-configs\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Overridable Galaxy configs</h3>\n<p>Traditionally, CloudMan controlled Galaxy configuration files such as <code>galaxy.ini</code> to ensure a suitable set of configuration options so that Galaxy runs well. With that, CloudMan would override any customizations to Galaxy configuration files. With this release, it is possible to retain custom <code>galaxy.ini</code> and <code>tool_conf.xml</code> settings. To override <code>galaxy.ini</code>, simply specify your desired settings in a file in <code>/mnt/galaxy/galaxy-app/config/cloudman_overrides/</code> directory whose name starts with a higher number number than a file that defines a setting already and your value will take precedence. New values can also be set. To override <code>tool_conf.xml</code>, use CloudMan’s template overriding mechanism. To use it, copy the original template from <code>/mnt/cm/cm/conftemplates</code> to <code>/opt/cloudman/config/conftemplates/</code> and modify as desired.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tools-were-updated-to-latest-version\"><a href=\"#tools-were-updated-to-latest-version\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Tools were updated to latest version</h3>\n<p>The GVL Galaxy instance comes with <a href=\"https://github.com/gvlproject/gvl.ansible.filesystem/blob/master/files/scripts/shed_tool_list.yaml.gvl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">over 200 tools</a> installed. Many of these were updated to include the latest revision, in addition to preserving the versions from previous GVL releases.</p>\n<h2 id=\"availability\"><a href=\"#availability\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Availability</h2>\n<p>GVL 4.4.0 can be launched from CloudLaunch: <a href=\"https://launch.usegalaxy.org/catalog/appliance/genomics-virtual-lab\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://launch.usegalaxy.org/catalog/appliance/genomics-virtual-lab</a> on either AWS or NeCTAR clouds.</p>\n</div>\n"}},"context":{}}
