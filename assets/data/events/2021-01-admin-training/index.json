Sessions will be <em>intensive and hands-on</em>, and taught by experienced instructors from the Galaxy Community. Participants will learn how to install, configure, customize, and extend their own Galaxy servers. Topics include tool configuration, authentication and user management, using heterogeneous storage and compute services, and many other topics that will enable you to get your own Galaxy server up and running, performing well, and used by your community.</p>\n<p>Galaxy is an open web based platform for biomedical data integration and analysis. It is deployed at large and small organizations around the world and used in a broad range of biomedical research domains, and across the tree of life.</p>\n<h1 id=\"format\"><a href=\"#format\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Format</h1>\n<p>This admin training will be presented as a series of instructional lectures and hands-on materials you can follow <em>at your own pace</em>.</p>\n<p>Given that we are targetting a global audience, participants will be able to complete materials at their convenience during the week, and instructors will be continuously available for students to check in with and discuss progress and questions.
