name=\"/events/gcc2019/header\" />\n\nGCC 2019 Code of Conduct\n========================\n\nThis code of conduct outlines our expectations for GCC2019 participants, as well as describing how to report unacceptable behavior. We are\ncommitted to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all and expect\nour code of conduct to be honored. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may\nbe banned from the community.\n\nOur open source community strives to:\n\n* **Be friendly and patient.**\n\n* **Be welcoming**: We strive to be a community that welcomes and\n  supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not\n  limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour,\n  immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual\n  orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status,\n  political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.\n\n* **Be considerate**: Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn\n  will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users\n  and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when\n  making decisions. Remember that we're a world-wide community, so you might\n  not be communicating in someone else's primary language.\n\n* **Be respectful**: Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is\n  no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some\n  frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a\n  personal attack. It’s important to remember that a community where people\n  feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.\n\n* **Be careful in the words that we choose**: We are a community of\n  professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do\n  not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary\n  behavior aren't acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to: Violent\n  threats or language directed against another person, Discriminatory jokes and\n  language, Posting sexually explicit or violent material, Posting (or\n  threatening to post) other people’s personally identifying information\n  (“doxing”), Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms,\n  Unwelcome sexual attention, Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above\n  behavior, Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to\n  stop, then stop.\n\n* **Try to understand why we disagree**: Disagreements, both social and\n  technical, happen all the time. It is important that we resolve disagreements\n  and differing views constructively. Remember that we’re different. Diversity\n  contributes to the strength of our community, which is composed of people\n  from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different\n  perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a\n  viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to\n  err and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping\n  to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.\n\nDiversity Statement\n-------------------\n\nWe encourage everyone to participate and are committed to building a community\nfor all. Although we will fail at times, we seek to treat everyone both as\nfairly and equally as possible. Whenever a participant has made a mistake, we\nexpect them to take responsibility for it. If someone has been harmed or\noffended, it is our responsibility to listen carefully and respectfully, and do\nour best to right the wrong.\n\nAlthough this list cannot be exhaustive, we explicitly honor diversity in age,\ngender, gender identity or expression, culture, ethnicity, language, national\norigin, political beliefs, profession, race, religion, sexual orientation,\nsocioeconomic status, and technical ability. We will not tolerate\ndiscrimination based on any of the protected characteristics above, including\nparticipants with disabilities.\n\nReporting Issues\n----------------\n\nIf you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns,\nplease report it by contacting any member of the [GCC2019 Organizing Committee](/events/gcc2019/organizers/). All reports will be handled with discretion. In your\nreport please include:\n\n* Your contact information.\n\n* Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If there\n  are additional witnesses, please include them as well. Your account of what\n  occurred, and if you believe the incident is ongoing. If there is a publicly\n  available record (e.g. a mailing list archive or a public IRC logger), please\n  include a link.\n\n* Any additional information that may be helpful.\n\nIf you file a report, a representative will contact you personally, review the\nincident, follow up with any additional questions, and make a decision as to\nhow to respond. If the person who is harassing you is part of the response\nteam, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. If the complaint\noriginates from a member of the response team, it will be handled by a\ndifferent member of the response team. We will respect confidentiality requests\nfor the purpose of protecting victims of abuse.\n\nAttribution & Acknowledgements\n------------------------------\n\nThis code of conduct is based on the Open Code of Conduct from the [TODO Group](http://todogroup.org/).\n"}},"context":{}}
