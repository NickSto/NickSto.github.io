The workshop will teach attendees the basics of Galaxy\nincluding the interface, using tools and creating, extracting and modifying\nworkflows. Attendees will be guided through three working examples in Galaxy:\nvariant calling, differential expression analysis and workflow creation and\nediting. At the end of the course, attendees will be able to utilize the Galaxy\nplatform to perform their own analysis and generate their own reproducible and\nshareable workflows.</p>\n"}},"context":{}}
