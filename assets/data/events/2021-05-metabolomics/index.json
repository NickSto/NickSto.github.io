We'll have a guest speaker: Amrita Cheema, Georgetown University School of Medicine in Washington DC, will present \"Radiometabolomics: Identification of Metabolic Predictors of Radiation Late Effects\". Amrita is involved in the <a href=\"https://www.abrf.org/metabolomics-mrg-\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ABRF Metabolomics Research Group</a> and we hope to discuss with her about training and standardization in metabolomics.</p>\n<p>If time allows, we will also discuss if there is interest in working on metabolomic tool(s) during the GCC hackathon. Suggestions for potential tools are more than welcome.</p>\n<p>Please join us.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Subscribe to the <a href=\"https://lists.galaxyproject.org/lists/metabolomics.lists.galaxyproject.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">metabolomics mailing list</a> receive community updates via email.</p>\n"}},"context":{}}
