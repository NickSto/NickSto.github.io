An Interactive Demonstration</h1>\n<p><strong>Wednesday, 5:45-7:00 PM, Room 305<br />\nOrganizer: <a href=\"http://cbs.umn.edu/contacts/timothy-j-griffin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tim Griffin</a>, University of Minnesota</strong></p>\n<p>The Galaxy framework has emerged as a useful and powerful tool for MS-based proteomics data analysis and also multi-omic application (for example see recent publications such as <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt.3134\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nat Biotechnol. 2015, 33:137-9</a>; <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1074/mcp.O115.048777\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mol Cell Proteomics. 2015, 14:3087-93</a>; <a href=\"http://www.mcponline.org/content/11/6/M111.015974.long\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mol Cell Proteomics. 2012, 11:M111.015974</a>). The Galaxy operating environment offers an informatics workbench where disparate software can be deployed and integrated into complex workflows. Galaxy also offers the ability to share complete workflows and data with other users, promoting reproducibility and dissemination of even complex data analysis schemes.</p>\n<p>This workshop will provide attendees the opportunity to take Galaxy for a 'test drive' in analyzing MS-based protoemics data. Attendees will have the opportunity to access a Galaxy instance and walk through the basic steps of setting up an analysis of representative MS data from a proteomics experiment. The hands-on tutorial will include steps such as pre-processing of mass spectral data, sequence database searching, and filtering and visualizing outputs.</p>\n<p>Attendees will also be introduced to basic operations and concepts of the Galaxy operating environment, such as the creation of histories and workflows, and functionalities for sharing tools and workflows with others. An overview of the current state of software available in Galaxy for proteomics and multi-omics applications will also be provided.</p>\n<p>The workshop will be led by both developers and users well-versed in the use of Galaxy for multi-omics data analysis.</p>\n<p>Attendees are encouraged to bring a laptop computer to participate.</p>\n<h2 id=\"accessible-galaxy-p-docker-container\"><a href=\"#accessible-galaxy-p-docker-container\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Accessible Galaxy-P Docker container</h2>\n<p>We have built a Docker container containing a Galaxy instance with the tools used in our ASMS workshop.  This container can be downloaded to your local computer, installed, and used for gaining more experience with Galaxy and its use in proteomics data analysis.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"http://z.umn.edu/asms2016docs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the instructions on accessing and installing the Docker container</a>.  When prompted, select “View the file” and hit “OK”. This documentation also provides instructions on how to use the Galaxy interface, build Histories and Workflows with some of the available tools, as well as other Galaxy functions.  This mirrors the content presented in the ASMS workshop, with additional details on the use of Galaxy.</p>\n<p>See the <a href=\"/use/galaxy-p/\">Galaxy-P</a> entry in the <a href=\"/use/\">public Galaxy servers directory</a> for additional Galaxy-P resources.</p>\n</div>\n"}},"context":{}}
