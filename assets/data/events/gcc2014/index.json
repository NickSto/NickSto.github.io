Steven is a Professor of Medicine, [Biostatistics](http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/), and [Computer Science](http://www.cs.jhu.edu/) at the [Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine](http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/som/) where he is also Director of the [Center for Computational Biology](http://ccb.jhu.edu/) at the [McKusick-Nathans Institute of Genetic Medicine](http://igm.jhmi.edu/).  Steven has made many prominent contributions to open source software, including several of the most popular tools used on Galaxy Platforms.  Recently he was awarded the  [2013 Benjamin Franklin Award for Open Access in the Life Sciences](http://www.bioinformatics.org/forums/forum.php?forum_id=10206), and the [2012 Balles Prize in Critical Thinking](http://www.csicop.org/news/show/skeptic_authors_steven_salzberg_and_joe_nickell_to_receive_balles_prize) for his [science column](http://www.forbes.com/sites/stevensalzberg/) at [Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/).\n\nSteve's GCC2014 talk will be on \"Transcriptomes and Exomes: Computational Challenges of NGS Data.\"\n\nAbout Galaxy\n------------\n\nGalaxy makes it easy to perform analysis interactively through the web, on arbitrarily large datasets. With hundreds of tools there are few limits on what can be done. Now with NGS tools & workflows for short-read mapping, ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, metagenomics, and pileup analysis, trackster browser, collaborative pages, and support for Galaxy in the Cloud.
