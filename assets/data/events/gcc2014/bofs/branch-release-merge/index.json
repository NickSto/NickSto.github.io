This may create huge challenges in the future, especially for instances in production which require a lot of maintenance and which run older versions of Galaxy. All Clouds and Clusters which require multiple extensions like:\n\n* huge file management (upload, etc)\n* authentication issues\n* cluster/cloud connectivity\n\nAnd the customization of these issues is not easy and straightforward.\n\nAudience\n========\n\nThose managing a local Galaxy instance with code customizations.\n\nWhen and Where\n==============\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <th> When </th>\n    <td> Monday, June 30, 6:15pm </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <th> Where </th>\n    <td> Salon A </td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nWho is Participating\n====================\n\nIf you are interested, please add your name below and/or send an email to [Nikolay Aleksandrov Vazov](http://www.usit.uio.no/om/organisasjon/uav/itf/ft/ansatte/nikolaiv/index.html).\n\n* [Nikolay Aleksandrov Vazov](http://www.usit.uio.no/om/organisasjon/uav/itf/ft/ansatte/nikolaiv/index.html)\n* [Hans-Rudolf Hotz](/people/hansrudolf-hotz/)\n* Peter Cock\n* ...\n\nTopics Covered\n==============\n\nManaging the releases\n---------------------\n\nThe only feasible way to avoid incompatibilities is to run updates regularly. First, here is a chance that some of the issues every single developer tried to solve themselves have already been addressed in the new release. Second, changes in the updates may make the customized solution easier. Yet, regular updates are very time consuming, especially when they concern production systems where admins have plenty of routine daily tasks. Customization will still remain a problem unless it can be carried out as a \"full-fledged\" plug-in.\n\nChoice of version control systems\n---------------------------------\n\ngithub or bitbucket. Both were appreciated, seems to be a question of taste as long as both provide very similar features and functionalities. Mercurial will still be used to pull the versions for installation.\n\nConfiguration Directories\n-------------------------\n\nWe discussed the possibility of replacing the configuration files by configuration directories. A customized setup will then require a specific file which will be integrated into the default setup.\n"}},"context":{}}
