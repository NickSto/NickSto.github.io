Regardless of national origin, any Galaxy community user or developer is welcome to fill it in.\n\nQuestionnaire results will be made public and fed into a recommendation that will influence the technical strategy across the ELIXIR pan-European bioinformatics infrastructure with regards the provision of Galaxy services and infrastructure nationally and internationally.\n\nWe would thus like to invite you to fill in this questionnaire by no later than 12pm (noon) BST on July 7th. Initial results will be discussed and presented while at the ELIXIR-Galaxy Workshop held at the Genome Seminar Room at the TGAC building (next door to the conference centre in the same Norwich Research Campus as the Galaxy Community Conference). Please add your name to this [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k_d9A4HDTcmjEhYW3FbVeEjcAkembhxupZZN3KQn0NA/edit#) if you are interested to attend.\n\nSummary\n-------\n\nSee the [BoF summary](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k_d9A4HDTcmjEhYW3FbVeEjcAkembhxupZZN3KQn0NA/edit?usp=sharing) for suggestions from each breakout group.\n\nAudience\n--------\n\nAny group using or planning to use Galaxy.\n\nWhen and Where\n--------------\n\nTuesday, 7 July, 18:00 in the Genome Seminar Room, in the nearby The Genome Analysis Center\n\nWho is Participating\n--------------------\n\nPlease add your name to this [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k_d9A4HDTcmjEhYW3FbVeEjcAkembhxupZZN3KQn0NA/edit#) if you are interested to attend.\n\nQuestions?\n----------\n\nPlease contact Manuel Corpas and Frederic Coppens\n"}},"context":{}}
