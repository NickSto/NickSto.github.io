Don't worry if you don't know what this group is .. the BoF is intended to define and create it!\n\nWhen:: Tuesday, 7 July, 12:30 (Lunch)\n\nWhere:: Franklin Room, JICCC\n\nContact:: [JenniferJackson](/people/jennifer-jackson/) & see [BoF](https://wiki.galaxyproject.org/Events/GCC2015/BoFs/GalaxyScientists) wiki\n\n<br />\n## Description\n\nMeetup of Galaxy Scientists and Analysts that will discuss strategies for communicating the \"Voice of the Scientist\" as a formal, decided, recognised, action orientated feedback group into Galaxy development priorities. Produce a group description, meeting plan, goals, non-goals, and overall purpose to present to the Galaxy Team for consideration to create the group as a new community-based feedback resource from the analysis and end-user perspective.\n\nAudience\n--------\n\nGalaxy Scientists interested in getting organised and contributing as to how Galaxy evolves. A dedicated group of team & community members that will provide a \"scientific voice\" to augment, guide, and offer feedback into Galaxy development efforts.\n<br />\n<br />\nIn addition, if you joined in on this year's [Data Wrangling Hackathon](http://gcc2015.tsl.ac.uk/data-hackathon/) (or wanted to but were unable), YOU want to BE HERE.\n\nWhen and Where\n--------------\n\nThe [time and location](/events/gcc2015/bofs/#bof-schedule) for this BoF is Tuesday, July 7th, over lunch at 12:30pm in the Franklin Room, JICCC\n\nWho is Participating\n--------------------\n\nIf you are interested, please add your name below.\n\n* <jen@galaxyproject.org>, Jennifer Hillman-Jackson\n* <kreddy4@jhmi.edu>, Karen Reddy\n* Mo Heydarian\n* [Dan Blankenberg](/people/dan/)\n* Michael Sauria\n* Gergely Izrael (izi)\n* Christian Rausch\n* Christian Schudoma\n* Hans-Rudolf Hotz,\n* Frederik Coppens\n* Rob Davidson\n* Helena Rasche\n* Maria Doyle\n* Peter van Heusden\n* Daniel Blankenberg\n* Meng Li\n* Bjoern Gruening\n* Ajayi Olabode\n* Annette McGrath\n* Dave Bouvier\n* Tim Griffin\n* Pratik Jagtap\n* Jennifer Hillman-Jackson\n* James Taylor\n\nQuestions?\n----------\n\nSend them to Jennifer Hillman-Jackson, Karen Ready or Mo Heydarian.\n\nFocus\n-----\n\nForm the group! Please reserve discussion topics to those that directly concern the core targets.\n\nHeads up [GalaxyAdmins](/community/galaxy-admins/), please join us! A primary target goal is to complement the input your community group provides to Galaxy. We'd love your help in determining optimal organizational strategies.\n\nIdeas\n-----\n\nAdd these before the BoF to aid in focusing our discussion. We'll create a <https://wiki.galaxyproject.org/GalaxyScientists> group wiki during and migrate Ideas and Resolutions content there.\n\n* Create the community group \"GalaxyScientists\" ??\n* **Publish a group wiki: <https://wiki.galaxyproject.org/GalaxyScientists>**\n* Who?\n* Why?\n* Feedback route(s)?\n* New moderated Twitter account @galaxyscientists?? Open to all core group members?\n* **Start organizing the group logistics. Meetings, communications, and such.**\n* Waaaay more .. what do you THINK?\n\nResolutions / Discussion\n------------------------\n\n**Purpose:** Discuss whether a Galaxy end-user group would be useful to the rest of the community and if so, kick start the group.\n\n**Decision:** Yes\n\n### Two tenets for the Galaxy Scientists Community\n\nThe Galaxy Scientists Community represents Galaxy end-users and gives them a voice to interact with the core team. However, \\*\\*the activities of the Galaxy Scientists Community shall not interfere with core team activities, priorities, and current user support, or feedback loops. \\*\\*\n\nThe Galaxy Scientists may or may not include support, training, faq projects (bundling of existing resources, creating new ones, all in a centralized location), **but should not interfere with [Galaxy Training Network](https://training.galaxyproject.org/).**\n\n### Action Items:\n\n1. **Establish formal name**\n   Galaxy Scientists\n2. **Leadership roles**  \n   First term (duration of term was not defined, likely to be about 1 year) representatives\n   * Maria Doyle, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Australia\n   * Frederik Coppens, VIB Gent, Belgium\n3. **Recognition** by GalaxyProject.org\n4. **Email list or forum** for discussion of end-user topics. NOT “how to”, but rather defining strategies and/or suggestions to improve the end-user experience\n5. **Electronic communications:** google drive docs, alternates\n6. **Meetings:** method, format, frequency\n7. meetings could be held via Google hangouts or equivalent video conferences\n8. meetings at GCC\n9. potential meetings of local subgroups\n\n### Long Term Goals\n\nTo start with, a set of initial long term goals was defined. These goals may be extended, adapted, or dropped after Galaxy Scientists has been going for a certain time.\n\n1. **Collection of usage metrics**\n   Initially based on pre-existing user groups across various institutions, the collection process is expected to capture data about how Galaxy is used by the wider end-user community in order to give the Galaxy Scientists a voice backed up by community needs and not by individual preferences.\n2. \\*\\*End-User Feedback \\*\\*\n   Establish a prioritized list of the likes, challenges, wish-list items, analysis needs, or gaps of the end-user community.\n3. **Communication and Collaboration**\n   Members offer support and/or work directly with tool developers on projects (e.g. the IUC). <br />\n   Examples:\n   1. define and share how important a tool/feature is to the user-community to aid in prioritization\n   2. test/review a tool/function so that is is presented optimally in the UI based on how end-users work within Galaxy\n   3. pairing scientists and software engineers on new development so that both can leverage their area(s) of expertise\n4. **Community**\n   Creating a place where end-users can discuss how they are using Galaxy with other data scientists outside of Q\\&A forums (or maybe within existing forums, but in a different space - Biostars has a forum area that may be appropriate, or a google group could be a better choice - nothing has been decided, yet)\n"}},"context":{}}
