[GCC2015](http://gcc2015.tsl.ac.uk/) will continue this tradition by again including *[Birds of a Feather (BoF)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birds_of_a_feather_(computing))* meetups.  Birds of a Feather meetups are informal gatherings where participants group together based on common interests.\n\nBoF meetups are encouraged throughout GCC2015.  We particularly want to encourage BoFs that flock at the end of each day, when time and space have been allocated for them.\n<br />\n\n## GCC2015 BoFs\n\n| BoF | When | Where | Summary | Audience |\n| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |\n| [**Common Workflow Language**](/src/events/gcc2015/bofs/cwl/index.md) | Wednesday, 8 July, 18:00 | Franklin Room, JICCC | Talk with CWL founders & enthusiasts\tResearch software engineers, analysts, developers, and the like. |\n| [**Data management challenges for larger galaxy installations**](/src/events/gcc2015/bofs/data-management-challenges/index.md) | Wednesday, 8 July, 12:30 (Lunch) | Franklin Room, JICCC | Data management challenges for larger Galaxy installations. | People using Galaxy to process large numbers of files |\n| [**Data Splitting and Parallelism**](/src/events/gcc2015/bofs/data-splitting-and-parallelism/index.md) | Tuesday, 7 July, 12:30 (lunch) | Watson Room, JICCC | Developer focused meeting to discuss data splitting and parallelism in Galaxy | Developers interested in working on internals Galaxy itself |\n| [**ELIXIR-Galaxy Workshop**](/src/events/gcc2015/bofs/elixir/index.md) | Tuesday, 7 July, 18:00 | Genome Seminar Room, in the nearby The Genome Analysis Center (TGAC) | Discuss technical strategy across the ELIXIR pan-European bioinformatics infrastructure with regards the provision of Galaxy services and infrastructure | Any group using or planning to use Galaxy  | \n| [**Extended Workflows**](/src/events/gcc2015/bofs/extended-workflow/index.md) | Wednesday, 8 July, 12:30 (lunch) | Watson Room, JICCC | This BoF is intended to extend the earlier training session on advanced workflows. | Those who attended the workflow training session and want to dig in more!  | \n| [**Friends of the Tool Shed**](/src/events/gcc2015/bofs/fots/index.md) | Tuesday, 7 July, 20:30 | we meet at the http://thecellarhouse.co.uk/ | Discuss utilities distribution approaches available to Galaxy and praise the Shed | Tool developers and Shed enthusiasts | \n| [**GalaxyAdmins**](/src/events/gcc2015/bofs/galaxy-admins/index.md) | Tuesday, 7 July, 18:20 | Franklin Room, JICCC | The annual in-person gathering of the GalaxyAdmins group | If you manage a Galaxy instance, this BoF is for you |\n| [**Galaxy Community UK BoF**](/src/events/gcc2015/bofs/galaxy-community-uk/index.md) | Wednesday, 8th July. 18:00 (6pm) | Watson Room, JICCC | Meeting of the Galaxy Community from the United Kingdom and Ireland | Galaxy Users/Devs/Admins from the British Isles and Ireland (and everybody else who's interested, we're called @GalaxyUKFriends after all). | \n| [**GalaxyScientists**](/src/events/gcc2015/bofs/galaxy-scientists/index.md) | Tuesday, 7 July, 12:30 (Lunch) | Franklin Room, JICCC | New Community Group? aka \"GalaxyUsers, GalaxyAnalysts, \"GalaxyDataTypes\" | Scientists using Galaxy interested in getting INVOLVED! | \n| [**Galaxy Training Network**](/src/events/gcc2015/bofs/galaxy-training-network/index.md) | Monday, 6 July, 18:50 | Franklin Room, JICCC | A BoF for people who want to teach the use of Galaxy or use Galaxy as a bioinformatics training tool.
