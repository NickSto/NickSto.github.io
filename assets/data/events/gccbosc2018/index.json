The event featured [two days of training](https://gccbosc2018.sched.com/overview/type/A.+Training), a two day meeting, and finished with [two (or four) days of intense collaboration at the GCC OBF CollaborationFest](https://gccbosc2018.sched.com/overview/type/C.+CollaborationFest).  The meeting featured joint and parallel sessions, and [shared keynotes](/events/gccbosc2018/keynotes/), poster and demo sessions, and social events.  Colocating GCC and BOSC brought together the widest possible community of bioinformatics developers and practitioners into a single place.\n\nThe event was organized by [Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU)](https://www.ohsu.edu/) and held at [Reed College](http://www.reed.edu/), a small liberal arts college in Portland. [Portland](/events/gccbosc2018/venue/) is a vibrant city in the American Northwest, close to the Cascade Mountains, the Oregon Coast, and the Columbia River.\n"}},"context":{}}
