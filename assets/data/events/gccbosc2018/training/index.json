The training topics were nominated by and then voted on by our communities.\n\n[GCCBOSC2018](https://gccbosc2018.sched.com/) will be held 25-30 June in Portland, Oregon, United States.  The [first day of training](https://gccbosc2018.sched.com/2018-06-25/overview/) is focused on Galaxy and offers two introductory tracks, one for researchers analyzing their data, and one for Galaxy admins.\n\nThe [second day of training](https://gccbosc2018.sched.com/2018-06-26/overview/) features five tracks covering a breadth of topics of interest to the BOSC and Galaxy communities.\n\nTopic Key\n=========\n\n|  | Code | Explanation |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Audience | BB | Beginning Bioinformatics Analyst |\n|                  | XB | Experienced Bioinformatics Analyst |\n|                  | IP | Infrastructure Provider |\n|                  | TD | Tool Developer |\n| Interface | GG | Galaxy or other Graphical User Interface |\n|                | CL | Command line, scripting and/or basic programming |\n\nQ: What makes a bioinformatic analyst *experienced?* <br />\nA: Attending at least one beginning bioinformatics session.\n\nThe topics\n==========\n\nThese topics are being offered at GCCBOSC 2018.\n\n| BB | XB | IP | TD |   | GG | CL |  | Topic                                    |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | ------------------- |\n| BB | XB | -  | -  | | -  | -  | | [Setting up for success: Everything you need to know when planning for an RNA-seq analysis (2 sessions)](http://sched.co/Doda) |\n| BB | XB | -  | -  | | GG | -  | | [Galaxy 101 - A gentle introduction to Galaxy](http://sched.co/DmxD) |\n| BB | XB | -  | -  | | GG | -  | | [RNA-Seq Analysis in Galaxy](http://sched.co/DmzG) |\n| BB | XB | -  | -  | | GG | -  | | [Galaxy For Proteogenomics !](http://sched.co/Dn1V) |\n| BB | XB | -  | -  | | GG | CL | | [GATK4: What's new and how to run it](http://sched.co/DnB1) |\n| BB | XB | -  | -  | | GG | CL | | [Data Carpentry Genomics Workshop: Data Organization and Automation with Shell (3 sessions)](http://sched.co/Dn8R) |\n| BB | XB | -  | -  | | GG | CL | | [Handling integrated biological data using Python (or R) and InterMine](http://sched.co/Dn4G) |\n| -  | XB | IP | -  | | GG | -  | | [Bioinformatics Training and Education with the Galaxy Training Network](http://sched.co/Drp9) |\n| -  | XB | IP | -  | | -  | CL | | [Practical use of the Galaxy API command line tools](http://sched.co/Dn9n) |\n| -  | XB | IP | TD | | -  | CL | | [Command line workflow management systems: Snakemake and Nextflow](http://sched.co/DnAi) |\n| -  | XB | IP | TD | | -  | CL | | [WDL, the Workflow Description Language](http://sched.co/DnAs) |\n| -  | XB | IP | TD | | -  | CL | | [Community built analyses that run everywhere with bcbio](http://sched.co/Dn3v) |\n| -  | XB | IP | TD | | -  | CL | | [Introduction to Common Workflow Language](http://sched.co/Dn9R) |\n| -  | -  | IP | TD | | -  | CL | | [Conda and Containers](http://sched.co/Dn3G) |\n| -  | -  | IP | -  | | -  | CL | | [Introduction to Galaxy Administration (3 sessions)](http://sched.co/Dn2O) |\n| -  | -  | IP | -  | | -  | CL | | [Galaxy Interactive Environments](http://sched.co/DnAc) |\n| -  | -  | IP | -  | | -  | -  | | [Galaxy Architecture](http://sched.co/DnB7) |\n"}},"context":{}}
