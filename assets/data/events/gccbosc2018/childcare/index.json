We encouraged people to bring their kids and to please take advantage of the services that GCCBOSC offered.\n\nSupport was offered for everyone from nursing infants though 12 year olds and was quite successful.  One of the keynote speakers was able to attend and present because of the availability of childcare, and another speaker presented her talk with her 4 month old asleep on her chest.\n\n---\n\nInfants and Nursing Parents\n---------------------------\n\nIf you have an infant and you want to have them with you during the day, then please bring them along.  The conference will provide a nearby room each day for nursing parents.  Please let us know so we can plan.\n\n**[Register your interest in a nursing room](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfBj9iscgZaX5iC5UG3yoZjZMWvsE3pe98qRe4gbn44S_UXjw/viewform)**\n\nChildcare\n---------\n\n<div class=\"float-left\">\n[<img src=\"./little_vikings-ship.png\" alt=\"Childcare provided by Little Vikings Childcare\" width=\"140\" />](http://www.littlevikings.org/)\n</div>\n\n***Note: Registration for childcare closed Friday, June 8.*** You can still sign up for the nursing room.\n\nSubsidized childcare *([thank you eLife and ISB](/events/gccbosc2018/childcare/#support-from-elife-and-isb)!)*  for kids ages 6 weeks to 12 years of age is provided by [Little Vikings](http://www.littlevikings.org/) child care in the [Smith Memorial Student Union](https://www.pdx.edu/student-union/) on the [Portland State University](https://www.pdx.edu/) campus in downtown Portland. Little Vikings' goal is to provide a safe, comfortable, joyful experience.\n\n* Lunch, snacks and beverages are provided for kids between 3 and 12.\n* We ask that parents bring pre-made bottles, and baby food and snacks for your infants and toddlers.\n\nLittle Vikings is a Nut Free Facility.\n\n**Childcare is available from 8am to 7pm, Monday-Saturday, June 25<sup>th</sup> - June 30<sup>th</sup>.**  Each day's core conference activities start at 9 and end by 6, giving you time to get kids settled, and to pick them up. If you want to attend evening sessions such as birds-of-a-feather or the conference dinner then *you are encouraged to bring your kids along to the evening sessions.* Evening sessions and the conference dinner tend to be informal events and having kids around contributes to that vibe.\n\nSpace is extremely limited.\n\n### Register for Childcare\n\nRegistration for childcare closed Friday, June 8.\n\n### Rates\n\nChildcare can be booked in half day increments.

Our mission is to help scientists accelerate discovery by operating a platform for research communication that encourages and recognises the most responsible behaviours in science.\n\neLife publishes work of the highest scientific standards and importance in all areas of the life and biomedical sciences. The research is selected and evaluated by working scientists and is made freely available to all readers without delay. eLife also invests in [innovation](https://elifesciences.org/about/innovation) through open-source tool development to accelerate research communication and discovery.

PSU is in downtown Portland and GCCBOSC is at Reed College which is several miles outside of downtown. If you are using Little Vikings childcare, it may make sense to stay close to PSU. See the conference FAQ page for some nearby options.\n\nThese options are particularly close to Portland State:\n\n* [Heathman Hotel](http://portland.heathmanhotel.com/), 1001 SW Broadway, 12 minute walk\n* [Paramount Hotel](http://www.portlandparamount.com/), 808 SW Taylor, 12 minute walk\n\nThere are several other options within a 15 minute walk:\n\n* [University Place Hotel](https://www.pdx.edu/university-place/), 310 SW Lincoln St, 14 minute walk (Portland State's own hotel, **use code STAYPDX**)\n* [Hotel Modera](https://www.hotelmodera.com/)\n* [Duniway Hotel](http://www3.hilton.com/en/hotels/oregon/the-duniway-portland-a-hilton-hotel-PDXTPHH/index.html), 545 SW Taylor,\n\nReed College also has a [list of recommended hotels](https://www.reed.edu/accommodations.html), including [several that are downtown](https://www.reed.edu/accommodations.html#downtown).\n"}},"context":{}}
