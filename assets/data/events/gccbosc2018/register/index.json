If you are on campus but are not registered for the day's event then you can also purchase lunch here.\n\nWe don't yet know if lunch will be provided during [CollaborationFest](/events/gccbosc2018/collaboration/).\n\nDinner\n------\n\nExcept for the conference dinner on Thursday (included with meeting registration), dinner is not included in your event registrations.  There are a number of restaurants and pubs in the [nearby Woodstock neighborhood](https://www.yelp.com/search?find_loc=Woodstock,+Portland,+OR\\&start=0\\&l=g:-122.61042594909668,45.48405300583157,-122.62330055236816,45.47502579850064), including [these recommendations](/events/gccbosc2018/venue/#recommended-pubs-and-restaurants-near-reed).
