There will be no fixed schedule,\nbut we expect to finish between 5 and 6pm.\n\nIdeas\n-----\n\nThe second day is the traditional developers day and we are planning to\nhave 3 to 4 hands-on sessions (1.5h). Every session will start with a 10\nminute talk and theoretical introduction, followed by 1h of hacking and\n20 minutes discussion and a small break until the next session begins.\nWe have a few proposed and prepared topics but we are flexible so we can\ndiscover new areas of the Galaxy.\n\nProposed topics:\n\n* ‘expand’ reports tool (API, Galaxy DB, JS)\n* Creating Conda packages and Docker containers (Conda, Docker, Tools)\n* Creating new Galaxy Docker flavours (Docker, Admin)\n* Enhancing training with Galaxy tours (JS, Training)\n\nPlease let us know what you are interesting in.\n\nQuestions?\n----------\n\nContact [Hans-Rudolf Hotz](/people/hansrudolf-hotz/) or [Björn Grüning](/people/bjoern-gruening/)\n"}},"context":{}}
