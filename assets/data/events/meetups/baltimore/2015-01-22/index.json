It was the right mix of current Galaxy users, people who want to learn how to use Galaxy, and students in Biology/Computer science programs. It was good to see academics unwind with a few beers and talk about their ideas to use Galaxy. The idea behind the meetup was to build a local community of Galaxy users, and to get to know one another personally. This would in turn foster collaborations and also bring forward better feedback to the <a href=\"/src/galaxy-team/index.md\">Galaxy Team</a> as well. </p>\n<p>The second meetup is going to be hosted in February, for which we hope to have a slightly more focussed agenda. To talk about one or a few of the topics raised during the course of the month. There is now a Baltimore newsletter if you are interested) which goes out to the members who signed up for the first meetup. We hope to have more people in the coming months, and to grow a stronger Galaxy community in Baltimore. </p>\n<p><a href=\"/src/people/enis-afgan/index.md\">Enis</a> &#x26; <a href=\"/src/people/nitesh-turaga/index.md\">Nitesh</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"theres-a-meetup\"><a href=\"#theres-a-meetup\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>There's a meetup!</h2>\n<p>Hey Everyone,</p>\n<p>We are looking forward to kicking off our first <a href=\"http://galaxyproject.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Galaxy Project</a> Meetup!

The core pillars of the application are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Accessibility</strong>: enable bench scientists to create bioinformatics analyses</li>\n<li><strong>Reproducibility</strong>: facilitate computational methods to be completely easily reproducible</li>\n<li><strong>Transparency</strong>: enable easy sharing and publishing of research data and analyses</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A sample instance of the application that is free to use is available at <a href=\"https://usegalaxy.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">usegalaxy.org</a>.\nAlthough focused around Galaxy, this meetup is open to anyone interested in the above topics without their specific ties to the application.</p>\n"}},"context":{}}
