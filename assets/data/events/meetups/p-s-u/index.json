The core pillars of the application are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Accessibility</strong>: enable bench scientists to create bioinformatics analyses</li>\n<li><strong>Reproducibility</strong>: facilitate computational methods to be completely easily reproducible</li>\n<li><strong>Transparency</strong>: enable easy sharing and publishing of research data and analyses</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A sample instance of the application that is free to use is available at <a href=\"https://usegalaxy.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">usegalaxy.org</a>.\nAlthough focused around Galaxy, this workshop is open to anyone interested in the above topics without their specific ties to the application.</p>\n</div>\n"}},"context":{}}
