Please feel free to update, comment, correct or add in anything we didn't have a chance to address during our session.\n\n\n## Platforms\n\n* Galaxy [Main](/src/main/index.md) and [CloudMan](/src/cloudman/index.md)\n* This group tends to not use Local instances\n\n## How Galaxy currently facilitates research\n\n* Galaxy [Main](/src/main/index.md)\n  * to identify 'vetted' tools\n  * to experiment with workflows before committing resources to Cloud instances\n* [CloudMan](/src/cloudman/index.md)\n  * to quickly access an instance with tools/reference data set-up and ready to go\n  * for storage (S3)\n* General Comments\n  * The 'Big Plus' for end users: Amazon allows Galaxy to be used in highly controlled IT environments. \n  * \"Galaxy better than commercial software\" (the [Galaxy Team](/src/galaxy-team/index.md) says \"thank-you\"!!)\n  * Trackster/Sweepster amazed everyone (shout-out to Jeremy!)\n  * New end user community to be aware of: Mass spec\n\n## What would be most helpful going forward\n\n### Better methods to identify 'Vetted' and 'Best Practice' tools\n\n* Applies to tools on [Main](/src/main/index.md), but in particular tools from [Tool Shed](/src/toolshed/index.md)\n* Community currently relies on [Main](/src/main/index.md) for this type of information\n* Extends to Libraries & other source Data, Workflows, Visualizations\n* Ideas (some overlap):\n  * Best practices as a way to adopt to correct tools\n  * A need to explain what is needed for particular analysis goals\n  * Tag tools/workflows based on publications, citations, peer-reviewed status\n  * **DOI** would be the *ideal* tag\n  * Methods to evaluate tools in the [Tool Shed](/src/toolshed/index.md)\n  * [Tool Shed](/src/toolshed/index.md): Download counts/trends e.g. downloads this week week\n  * [Tool Shed](/src/toolshed/index.md): Flag bad objects, like craigslist, to alert admin moderator\n\n### Data integration between Main and CloudMan\n\n* S3 bucket attachment\n* Ease transfer of libraries/datasets/histories/workflows/pages/etc (primary objects) between [Main](/src/main/index.md) &harr; [CloudMan](/src/cloudman/index.md)\n\n### Tool integration between Tool Shed and CloudMan\n\n* Ease installation of tools on cloud instances\n\n**ACTION:** For all above - Discuss/Prioritize\n\n## Requests\n\n* Add a free text \"Header tool\" that doesn't proliferate/duplicate datasets, or at least keeps to min. Alt actions on form: add line, remove/replace lines. E.g. UCSC custom tracks: track line for bedgraph file, browser line. May be two changes. **ACTION:** Needs clarification then bitbucket (Dan/Jen)\n* Tools to do file conversions to/from GenomeSpace or was this a \"Get Data' tool request? **ACTION:** Team discuss then bitbucket (Jen)\n\n## Issues\n\n* Genome access was hurdle to Local install - Dan mentioned rsync server & auto genome tool. **ACTION:** Communicate/wiki (Jen/Dan)\n* [CloudMan](/src/cloudman/index.md) auto-scaling is not working well for long running jobs - e.g. Tophat. **ACTION:** Team discuss then bitbucket. (Jen)\n\n## Support\n\n* Mailing list &rarr; Forum\n  * Galaxy-dev 1st. **ACTION:** Switch now (Dannon/Jen). Maybe add Google Searches (Dave).\n  * Galaxy-user 2nd. **ACTION:** Dual Forum/List ~ 1 year, then transition to forum only. (Dannon/Jen/Dave).\n  * Others no change.\n* Trackster .... any data - rna, small genome region, etc. can be used as 'ref genome' with or without sequence. **ACTION:** Tutorial. (Jeremy/Jen)\n* Multiple versions of tools in UI. **ACTION:** Tutorial. (Jen)\n* Of interest: CloudMan Costs ~ $900 for 1 flow cell Hi-Seq analysis run. **ACTION:** Useful info to capture in wiki where users could share usage data? (Dave)\n\n# Plan of Action\n\n* See **ACTION** items inline above\n* Others to be added\n\n * \n\n# Solutions\n\n* Soon!\n\nMore to come ...\n"}},"context":{}}
