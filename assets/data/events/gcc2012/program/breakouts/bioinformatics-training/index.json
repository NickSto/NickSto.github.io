Please feel free to update them.\n\n\n## Platforms\n\n* There is not a \"teaching\" instance of Galaxy anywhere.  Options for training include using your own instance, using main, or using a cloud instance.\n* Weeklong course at UC Davis with everyone doing their own bioinformatics on the cloud.  This is very inexpensive.\n* having 40 people on same instance can be a problem\n\n## What Participants Have Been Doing\n\n* Weeklong course on bioinformatics.\n* Two back to back courses.  Only used UCSC encode and Galaxy.  RNA-Seq analysis.\n* Perl for bioinformatics.\n* Use Galaxy for training, bioinformatics school\n* Don't use Galaxy internally at the bioinformatics core, but do use it for training.\n  * Started teaching with command line and that was a disaster.\n* Use Galaxy to teach students, some of whom have not used a computer before.  Galaxy might be too complicated for that group.\n\n## Goals for Training\n\n* Want to be able to teach biologists enough so that they can do the analysis, but also to have them learn how to do in depth analysis.\n* To learn programming\n  * Galaxy as a visual programming language.\n  * Don't have to teach R or Perl, but the ideas: transform the ides\n* Make bioinformatics training a part of medical education.\n* Teach people to do their own analysis.\n\n## Challenges\n\n* Not enough time for training.  Just do intro to bioinformatics using Galaxy\n* Problem with teaching is that participants forget it after a month, if they don't use it frequently after the training.\n* Teaching R is an order of magnitude harder to teach than perl\n* Do you teach the details or high level?\n  * Researchers who have specific needs.  \n  * You have students who you want to teach basic understanding too \n  * We also need to train the biologists and chemists to use the tools, but too understand the outputs.\n  * Some past bioinformatics training focused on statistics to the point of alienating biologists\n* Trainers can't know every detail of every tool\n* How do you communicate the complexity of analysis and tools?\n  * Can ask researchers \"what do you want to assume?\"  That's a lot work.\n  * Asking \"which statistical test do you want to use\" is not a question that many researchers can answer meaningfully.\n* Biologists are really good at following protocols, as long as they are at the bench.  Following recipes on computers is not the same thing.\n* Researchers that just want the data analyzed without understanding analysis.  Some would prefer to have an analysis blackbox, with a red button that says \"analyze.\"  \n* The interface for files in Galaxy is confusing for users.\n* How do you have a meaningful example that runs fast.\n* Number of tools is daunting\n* Bioinformatics courses are not as good as many other courses\n  * Textbooks are not as good\n  * Field is developing so fast; no chance to standardize\n  * End up with *Bioinformatics for dummies* courses\n\n## Solutions\n\n* Jeremy's parameter walking can make it clear that they can get different results.  \n  * Flip side is this can be used to get the results they want.\n  * Demonstrate how sensitive things are.\n* Improve interface for history / files in Galaxy\n  * tie together files that are produced as a chunk.\n  * Change it to be more hierarchical.  Have folders.  Too many files, e.g. cufflinks get 11 files.\n  * Get Multiple views.\n  * Does Galaxy have access to Human Computer Interaction folks?\n* Struggling with tools can get the point across that this is inherently difficult\n* Galaxy is about the making the simple things easy to do, so you can get to the science.\n* Include a \"Hey this is important!\" notice on complex tools.\n* What students really like:  Show them and RNA-Seq un-replicated, and then we contrive a grand challenge and do some analysis to gain insight into that.  Split people up into groups and have them tackle it.  They like that a lot.\n* hands-on workshops may be overrated.  Maybe speak for an hour, and then have participants go off for a few days.\n* Take a high-profile paper and reproduce the results from a paper.  That's going to be motivating.\n* Set up a catalog of teaching material\n  * Want to be able to share material\n  * slide sharing would be helpful\n* Teach good Galaxy practices\n  * Always rename your output files\n\n# Plan of Action\n\nWe did not discuss a plan of action at the breakout, but we will here.  \n\nMore to come ...\n"}},"context":{}}
