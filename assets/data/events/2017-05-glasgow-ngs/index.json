Galaxy will then be used to create an analysis pipeline\nfor variant calling in a human disorder.  We will then use a publicly available\ndata set to explore and work with the data from raw reads through to variant\nannotation â€“ this will include: QC, trimming, mapping, variant calling, variant\nannotation and what this means. The user will learn how to map the raw reads to\nreference sequences and identify SNPs, and how to manipulate the output files.\nFinally, an open source software will be used to visualise the data.</p>\n"}},"context":{}}
