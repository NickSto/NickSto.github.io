CoFests are about <em>contributing and learning how to contribute to all aspects of Galaxy</em>, including training material, community infrastructure, documentation, unit tests, bug reports, and yes, even code. <em>First and foremost Galaxy CoFests are about growing the community of future contributors.</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"papercuts\"><a href=\"#papercuts\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Papercuts!</h2>\n<p>Papercut events are CoFests that address annoying, but easy to fix bugs (\"paper cuts\").  <em>Papercut CoFests</em> are 24 hour, worldwide collaborative events, dedicated to</p>\n<ul>\n<li>reducing irritants in the Galaxy ecosystem</li>\n<li><em>and welcoming new contributors by guiding them through the process of fixing these irritants and thus becoming contributors to Galaxy.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>See the <a href=\"/src/events/cofests/papercuts/index.md\">Papercuts CoFests home page</a> for more information and the date of the next event.</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"stay-informed\"><a href=\"#stay-informed\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Stay Informed</h2>\n<p>Want to know when CoFests are coming?
