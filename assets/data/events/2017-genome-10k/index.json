It takes users of bioinformatics tools away from the complications of the command-line and into a web-based point-and-click environment.</p>\n<p>The training session will cover three main areas:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Galaxy 101. This will involve an introduction to Galaxy where users will learn how to use the tool-data-interface ethos of Galaxy and perform simple data manipulation tasks. They will also learn about creating and editing Galaxy workflows and how to apply those workflows to data.</li>\n<li>Using Galaxy to learn RNA-seq analysis using available gene annotation.</li>\n<li>Using Galaxy to learn RNA-seq analysis where no gene annotation is available.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>By the end of the training course users should be comfortable with navigating and using Galaxy and also have a better understanding of RNAseq and de novo transcriptome annotation and expression analysis.</p>\n"}},"context":{}}
