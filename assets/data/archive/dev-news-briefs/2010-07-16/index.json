The main changes are that the Web UI returns redirects and rendered templates, whereas the API returns various HTTP status codes and JSON.</li>\n<li>Implement more functionality.</li>\n<li>The request and response format should be considered alpha and are subject to change.  They will be standardized as the API matures.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"hints-to-get-started-can-be-found-in-scriptsapireadme\"><a href=\"#hints-to-get-started-can-be-found-in-scriptsapireadme\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Hints to get started can be found in ~/scripts/api/README</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Allow for uploading single files in a zip archive.  Adapted from a patch from Pablo Cingolani.  Also removed obsolete binseq.zip and txtseq.zip formats, and removed txtseq and binseq from datatypes.</li>\n<li>Add GTF as a default datatype for Galaxy.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"administrative-job-lock\"><a href=\"#administrative-job-lock\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Administrative Job Lock</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Admins can now lock (and unlock) all job dispatching.  New jobs will remain in the job queue in the 'waiting' state until the lock is removed.  Existing dispatched jobs are unaffected, and jobs can still be submitted, but they will not dispatch.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"existing-feature-improvements\"><a href=\"#existing-feature-improvements\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Existing Feature Improvements</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Restructure and document the universe_wsgi.ini.sample config file.</li>\n<li>Add ability to view hidden datasets in the same fashion as you would deleted ones in the history panel.  Un-hiding also works in the same fashion.</li>\n<li>Enable bedgraph files to be displayed in UCSC genome browser.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"history-export--import\"><a href=\"#history-export--import\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>History export / import</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Include annotations and tags when exporting and importing histories to/from files.</li>\n<li>Include job information when exporting and importing histories to/from files. This enables jobs associated with an imported history to be rerun and hence affords a history's analyses to be reproduced exactly. Jobs also have a new flag, imported, that is set to false by default but is true when a job is created via import. Also re-factored export/import code to use custom JSON encoders.  This code is in a very alpha/beta state: it may not work well, at all, or as expected. Complex datasets and/or jobs are likely not yet handled. Use with caution.  Also, due to security issues, history/import and history/export methods are not currently web-accessible. Admins must manually make these methods accessible if they want to use them.</li>\n<li>Security checks when opening and/or copying files from imported archive</li>\n<li>Implemented options to gzip, include/exclude hidden datasets, and include/exclude deleted datasets when exporting to archive.</li>\n<li>New Job actions - Send Email action, Delete action.  Note that delete action is dangerous and will break a workflow if you delete datasets that are required in later steps.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"improvements-to-gops-subtract-tool\"><a href=\"#improvements-to-gops-subtract-tool\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Improvements to GOPS subtract tool</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Preserve metadata for interval inputs</li>\n<li>Allow arbitrary mix of interval and GFF inputs</li>\n<li>Functional tests updated to test new functionality.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"improvements-to-gops-intersect-tool\"><a href=\"#improvements-to-gops-intersect-tool\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Improvements to GOPS intersect tool</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Preserve metadata for interval inputs</li>\n<li>Allow arbitrary mix of interval and GFF inputs</li>\n<li>Functional tests updated to test new functionality.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"extract-genomic-dna-tool\"><a href=\"#extract-genomic-dna-tool\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Extract genomic DNA tool</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Enhance to accept and produce GFF files and added functional tests for this feature.</li>\n<li>Fix bug so that fasta identifier produced by this tool for GFF files is consistent with GFF coordinates.</li>\n<li>Changed the way sam_indel_filter tool expects quality score cutoffs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"trackster\"><a href=\"#trackster\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Trackster</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Now skips incorrect twobit.loc locations</li>\n<li>Track browsers can now be embedded in Galaxy Pages as multiple browsers can now exist at the same time after re-factoring.

Some scrolling bugs have been fixed as well.</li>\n<li>Move trackster.css to common stylesheet folder, fix small error in color</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"galaxy-on-the-cloud\"><a href=\"#galaxy-on-the-cloud\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Galaxy on the cloud</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Removed extra cloud clause left from earlier code cleanup.

The requests controller now includes only the grid definition and the requests_admin controller now includes only the request_type code and the sequencer data transfer code.</li>\n<li>Added an option to rename sequencer datasets by prepending the experiment name.</li>\n<li>Removed the db engine echo option in the data transfer</li>\n<li>Update UCSC table browser data source tools to treat data marked as 'gff' as 'gtf'.</li>\n<li>Make the PSU BX browser a UCSC browser instead of being a different display type.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"functional-tests\"><a href=\"#functional-tests\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Functional tests</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Removed binseq.zip test and replaced it with a zip test.</li>\n<li>Switch methods using sendmail to SMTP instead.</li>\n<li>Set a default (database/universe.sqlite) in manage_db.py in case the deprecated database_file is unset</li>\n<li>Detect pdf files on upload (patch from Brad Chapman).

New qqplot image.  Fixes to fix test output generators to only provide one set of pval columns.</li>\n<li>Added Sscrofa9.58 to manual_builds.txt and removed phiX from builds.txt.sample (it's in manual_builds.txt)</li>\n<li>Add checks to get_estimated_display_viewport() methods for tabular data types to ensure datasets are valid before generating display links ( this fix should eliminate some memory problems ) and standardize the returned values from the methods.  Also fix several calls to dataset.has_data where the call assumed a property rather than a method.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"new-tools\"><a href=\"#new-tools\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>New Tools</h2>\n<h3 id=\"indel-analysis-tool-section-including-these-new-tools\"><a href=\"#indel-analysis-tool-section-including-these-new-tools\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Indel Analysis tool section including these new tools</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>indel_analysis</li>\n<li>indel_table</li>\n<li>indel_sam2interval tools</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"bug-fixes\"><a href=\"#bug-fixes\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Bug Fixes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix bug that prevented correct toggling of recently used tool menu.</li>\n<li>Enable recently used tools menu to show only tools that are currently in the toolbox.</li>\n<li>Fix bug in metadata setting for intersect tool.</li>\n<li>Fix IE crashing on pages with grids</li>\n<li>Bug fix for importing a history when not logged in.</li>\n<li>Fix to allow administrators to create users when use_remote_user is enabled.</li>\n<li>Fixed a form importer bug in forms.py</li>\n<li>Fixed issue #345 - Incorporated Brad Chapman's patch which handles skipping of order checking for join_wrapper tool version >=7, which would otherwise end in an error.
