A \"tool\" wraps an external application, script, or shell command - describing both the user interface and how to translate it into a command-line via a simple XML file.\n\n* [Tutorial: Developing a Tool](/admin/tools/add-tool-tutorial/)\n\nContributing to the Extended Galaxy Ecosystem\n---------------------------------------------\n\nIn addition to the Galaxy core project and tool projects listed above - there are many open source projects related to Galaxy that would welcome contributions - many but certainly not all of them can be found on the [galaxyproject landing page](https://github.com/galaxyproject/) on github. Many more are in the following list (the Issues pages of these projects offer many great ways to contribute to the Galaxy ecosystem).\n\n* [bioblend](https://github.com/galaxyproject/bioblend) - The Python client for the Galaxy and CloudMan APIs.
