However both of these Docker-based features are limited by the fact they are constrained to a single Docker container. The new Docker projects Docker Swarm and Docker Compose could improve these features by provide orchestration across multiple containers. Docker Compose could be use to breakup the big Docker Galaxy stable container into smaller more flexible pieces that would be both more manageable and scaleable.

This is an exciting project that provides the dual benefits of allowing Galaxy users to easily leverage the complex and cutting edge tools developed in R while allowing R authors to easily create and disseminate accessible web interfaces for their modules through Galaxy. It would be great to determine if this idea could be taken further and make this process more seamless - lowering the barrier to entry. Specifically it would be great if one could leverage the existing Bioconductor documentation to build these tools instead of requiring the functions to be built for Galaxy or at least provide a higher-level intermediary to bridge existing functions more easily. Additionally, once tools are created it would be great if the process of publishing them to the Galaxy Tool Shed could be automated as well for maximum impact.

Additionally, Refinery provides a data repository with rich meta data and provenance information, as well as data visualization components to support interpretation of analysis results. Refinery provides user interfaces to instantiate Galaxy workflows with data sets stored in the Refinery data repository. In order to prepare a Galaxy workflow for use in Refinery, the workflow has to be annotated. This includes the description of the number, type, and relationship (single, paired, etc.) of required and optional inputs and the definition of which analysis outputs should be imported back into Refinery.\nTo facilitate the annotation of Galaxy workflows, the existing Galaxy workflow editor could be extended with additional features to allow users to add these annotations. Alternatively, the current Refinery workflow viewer could be extended to enable such workflow annotations after a workflow has been imported into Refinery via the Galaxy Workflow API.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, since workflow annotations for Refinery are currently stored in general annotation fields, they can interfere with general comments and notes added to a Galaxy workflow. It is desirable to store the Refinery workflow annotation in dedicated fields of the workflow data model so as not to interfere with general annotations. This would require either modification of the Galaxy workflow data model as well as the corresponding APIs, or the development of a workflow annotation model that stores such information directly in Refinery.</p>\n<p><strong>Expected Outcomes</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Extended Galaxy or Refinery workflow data model to store workflow annotation</li>\n<li>Editor to create annotation of Galaxy workflows for use in Refinery</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Stretch Goals</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Support creation of new data types in Refinery if required by outputs of newly annotated workflows.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Possible Mentors</strong> <a href=\"http://gehlenborg.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nils Gehlenborg</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/hackdna\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ilya Sytchev</a></p>\n<p><strong>Required Skills</strong> JavaScript and Python programming, preferably some experience with <a href=\"https://www.djangoproject.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Django</a>, <a href=\"http://d3js.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">D3.js</a>, and <a href=\"https://angularjs.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AngularJS</a>.</p>\n<p>** Potentially Helpful Skills ** Knowledge of basic graph algorithms and common bioinformatics data analysis workflows.</p>\n<h2 id=\"visualization-plugin-for-proteomics\"><a href=\"#visualization-plugin-for-proteomics\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Visualization Plugin for Proteomics</h2>\n<p>Implement Galaxy <a href=\"/data-providers/\">data providers</a> and <a href=\"/visualizations-registry/\">visualization plugins</a> for viewing the results of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_mass_spectrometry\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mass spectrometry</a> based protein and/or peptide identification experiments.

This Object Store interface allows datasets to be ‘physically’ disconnected from a particular instance of Galaxy while the application can still access and interact with them. This opens the door for providing various storage mediums where the data is actually stored. Ultimately, thus allows a user to associate self-provisioned external storage resources with their Galaxy account and move beyond the imposed quota or limitations on any given Galaxy instance. Thus far, an abstract hierarchical store, Amazon S3, iRODS, and various local disk object stores have been implemented. However, use of an Object Store within Galaxy is an application-wide setting instead of being a per-user setting allowing users to specify their own back-end storage medium. Additionally, linking with the Google Drive is highly desirable allowing user to leverage the <a href=\"http://googleforeducation.blogspot.com/2014/09/announcing-drive-for-education-21st.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Google Drive for Education</a> program.</p>\n<p><strong>Expected Outcomes</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Implement a Galaxy Object Store for Google Drive</li>\n<li>Allow per-user specification of a back-end data store</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Stretch Goals</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Provide a method to archive Galaxy datasets/histories to a back-end data store</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Required Skills</strong> Python programming</p>\n<p><strong>Potentially Helpful Skills</strong> Familiarity with Galaxy and/or object store APIs, familiarity with cloud computing concepts</p>\n<p><strong>Possible Mentors</strong> <a href=\"/people/enis-afgan/\">Enis Afgan</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"integrate-bcbio-nextgen-pipelines-into-galaxy\"><a href=\"#integrate-bcbio-nextgen-pipelines-into-galaxy\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Integrate bcbio-nextgen Pipelines into Galaxy</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/chapmanb/bcbio-nextgen\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bcbio-nextgen</a> project provides validated, scalable, community developed best practice pipelines - in particular for variant calling and RNA-seq analysis. The goal of this project would be to enable the use of bcbio-nextgen pipelines from within Galaxy and other workflow platforms.</p>\n<p>For smaller jobs - it should be possible to build traditional Galaxy tools to run bcbio-nextgen pipelines.

Ubuntu) either via manual installation or using the Docker image (see above).  But to integrate Galaxy as a full-fledged Debian package brings many potential advantages such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Basic installation reduced to \"apt-get install galaxy-server\"</li>\n<li>Updates of Galaxy core managed via apt-get</li>\n<li>Updates and installation of Galaxy tools managed via apt-get</li>\n<li>Harmonisation of Galaxy login accounts with system shell accounts</li>\n<li>Interaction with Apache/Nginx server auto-configured by the package</li>\n<li>Interaction with SFTP for file uploads auto-configured by the package</li>\n<li>Interaction with SQL database auto-configured by the package</li>\n<li>etc...</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Initial packaging has already been accomplished by Tim Booth as part of the <a href=\"http://environmentalomics.org/bio-linux/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bio-Linux</a> project. This project would involve updating this package for the latest Galaxy versions and make changes to Galaxy itself with the goal of one day being able to include Galaxy in Debian directly.</p>\n<p>The biggest impediment to the inclusion of Galaxy within Debian is Galaxy's handling of Python dependencies. Galaxy resolves its own fixed (often older) versions of dependencies - a properly packaged Debian Galaxy would have to use the system versions of dependencies which will require updating Galaxy dependencies.</p>\n<p><strong>Expected Outcomes</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Updated versions of the existing Bio-Linux Ubuntu packages for latest Galaxy.</li>\n<li>Making the packages work in Debian Sid - e.g. convert Bio-Linux <a href=\"http://upstart.ubuntu.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Upstart</a> scripts to <a href=\"http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Systemd</a>.</li>\n<li>Build list of all Galaxy dependencies not currently in Debian or Debian Med and outline an upgrade plan.</li>\n<li>Package Galaxy's <a href=\"http://bioblend.readthedocs.org/en/latest/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bioblend</a> dependency for Debian and attempt to get it added to <a href=\"https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-med/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Debian Med</a>.

These consist of a Docker container providing a webservice that is proxied to a Galaxy user on request. They allow users to flexibly analyse their datasets without the overhead of download/uploading/tracking which commands they ran, and so on. Galaxy currently provides the proxying using a small NodeJS proxy to handle requests with respect to the new Interactive Environments (IEs).
