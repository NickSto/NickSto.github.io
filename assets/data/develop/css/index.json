To build the LESS file into the css files please read the `static/style/README` included with the distribution.\n\n* follow LESS conventions\n* use sensible organization and modularity.\n* Anything that's going to be commonly used across components as a fundamental widget or style should probably be in base.  \n* To add to that, to the extent possible use existing styles wherever they make sense.\n\n* If you want to run grunt with spritesmith on Mavericks you need to update grunt-spritesmith https://github.com/Ensighten/grunt-spritesmith/issues/45\n"}},"context":{}}
