For tests to work, the repository must include a directory named <strong>test-data</strong> somewhere in its file system hierarchy, and all functional test input and output datasets must be included in this directory.</p>\n<p>Tools contained in installed repositories will fall into one of two possible categories: tools eliminated from the Galaxy distribution and \"migrated\" to the tool shed, and tools contained in repositories that are manually installed by the Galaxy administrator.</p>\n<p>Entries for all \"migrated\" tools are contained in the tool panel configuration file named migrated_tools_conf.xml in the Galaxy installation directory.</p>\n<p>Note that the path to your tool dependency directory must be set up correctly - the examples below assume you have configured [galaxyroot]/tool_dependencies as that path in config/galaxy.ini.</p>\n<p>To test  tools, run the following command from the Galaxy installation directory.</p>\n<pre><code>export GALAXY_TOOL_DEPENDENCY_DIR=tool_dependencies; sh run_tests.sh -migrated\n</code></pre>\n<p>Entries for tools included in repositories that are manually installed by the Galaxy administrator are defined in one or more shed-related tool panel configuration files (e.g., shed_tool_conf.xml,shed_tool_conf1xml, etc). These files are all named in the comma-separated configuration setting for <strong>tool_config_file</strong> in your local config/galaxy.ini file. The functional test framework currently supports only a single file named <strong>shed_tool_conf.xml</strong>, so if you have installed repositories that contain tools using more than 1 shed-related tool panel config file or a file with a different name, you'll need to manually change the following code line near the top of the file ~/scripts/functional_tests.py (at the time of this writing, this is line #51 in the file) so that the Python list contains all of your shed-related tool panel configuration file names.</p>\n<pre><code>installed_tool_panel_configs = [ 'shed_tool_conf.xml' ]\n</code></pre>\n<p>To run functional tests for tools included in repositories that are manually installed by the Galaxy administrator, run the following command from the Galaxy installation directory.</p>\n<pre><code>export GALAXY_TOOL_DEPENDENCY_DIR=tool_dependencies;  sh run_tests.sh -installed\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n"}},"context":{}}
