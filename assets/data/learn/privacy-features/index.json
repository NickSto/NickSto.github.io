End-users are in full control of specifying more privacy for their own data. Read below for how.</p>\n<p>When working at a different Galaxy server, contact the administrators for clarification. Contact information is commonly found on the home page of a Galaxy server and/or included on known public Galaxy Server's <a href=\"/use/\">directory pages</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"basics\"><a href=\"#basics\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Basics</h2>\n<p>Galaxy provides means for users and administrators to set data privacy. The model allows permissions to be set on a fine-grained level, from completely private through a couple of users to entire collaborative groups.</p>\n<p>Users may choose the default permissions that newly created datasets will acquire.  These defaults apply to datasets acquired from outside of Galaxy, via sources such as the upload tool, UCSC, BioMart and EpiGRAPH.  Datasets within Galaxy, such as those imported from a dataset library, or shared from another user retain the permissions set in the library or by the sharing user.  Permissions on datasets created through running a tool are derived from the input datasets.  More details on how permissions are set can be found below.</p>\n<h2 id=\"key-operations\"><a href=\"#key-operations\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Key Operations</h2>\n<p>Following list contains the most important operations everybody should know with regards to dataset privacy.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h3 id=\"change-the-privacy-settings-of-individual-dataset\"><a href=\"#change-the-privacy-settings-of-individual-dataset\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Change the privacy settings of individual dataset</h3>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For datasets you have created (or were given permissions) you can control what roles can access it.
