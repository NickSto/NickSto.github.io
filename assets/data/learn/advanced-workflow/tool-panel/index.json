But, if you use a workflow frequently, it can be helpful to have it listed at the top. *See the tutorial below for step-by-step details*. Or, do the following:\n\n* Go the the Worflow home page by clicking on the **Workflows** link in the upper masthead.\n* On the bottom of that page, in the section 'Other options', click on the button 'Configure your workflow menu'.\n* The next page lists all of your workflows. To place any at the top of your workflow list, mark the checkbox in the column **Show in menu**, scroll to the end of the page, and click on \"Save\"!\n\nHiding Intermediate Steps\n-------------------------\n\nCustomizing a workflow so that only one or some of the jobs included are active in the History panel can be a useful way to reduce clutter. This can also make a complex workflow act more **like a tool**.\n\nHide intermediate workflow steps using the **workflow editor**.\n\n---\n\nTutorial: Promote a Workflow with Hidden Steps\n----------------------------------------------\n\nStep-by-step instructions for promoting a workflow and hiding intermediate steps.\n\n### Where are Workflows in the Tool Panel?\n\nAccess Galaxy and click on **Analyze Data** in the top masthead to reach the *Analysis Home View*. The Tool Panel is on the far left. Your workflows are at the bottom of the list of tools (scroll down if needed).\n\nClicking on **All workflows** will display workflows *owned by you* or *shared with you* in the center panel.\n\nIf you see workflows listed above **All workflows**, these have been ***promoted*** for quick access. Do not see any or want to add more? That is what this tutorial will explain how to do.\n\n<div class='indent'> <img src=\"/images/learn/workflow_tool_access_all_from_tool_panel.png\" alt=\"workflows in the tool panel\" width=\"700\" /> <br />*workflows in the **tool panel***</div>\n\n### Go to the Workflow Management View\n\nTo edit a workflow or to manage where it is displayed, go the management view by clicking on **Workflows** in the top masthead from any page or by using the button at the right top of the **All workflows** list view.\n\n<div class='indent'> <img src=\"/images/learn/workflow_tool_go_to_management_view.png\" alt=\"going to workflow management\" width=\"600\" /> <br />*going to workflow **management***</div>\n\n### Navigating the Workflow Management View\n\n1. The **Workflows** link is in the top masthead.\n2. **Your workflows** lists all workflows owned by you.\n3. Each workflow has a menu of options. Access the menu by clicking on it.\n4. The number of steps in each workflow is summarized in this view.\n5. **Workflows shared with you by others** lists workflows that you do not own, but have been granted access to. These also have a menu. You can run a workflow without owning it, but to edit you must make a copy first.\n6. Who shared any particular workflow with you is listed in this view.\n7. **Other options** contains additional workflow functions. **Configure your workflow menu** is the function this tutorial will focus on.\n8. The **Create new workflow** function will launch a new blank canvas in the **Workflow Editor**.\n9. The **Upload or import workflow** function will load a workflow saved to a file or import a workflow through a link from another Galaxy server.\n\n<div class='indent'> <img src=\"/images/learn/workflow_tool_management_view.png\" alt=\"workflow management view\" width=\"700\" /> <br />*workflow **management view ***</div>\n\n### Configure Your Workflow Menu\n\nStarting on the **Workflow Management View** page, scroll to the bottom and click on the button for this function to access the view where modifications are made. (see **6** in the graphic above)\n\n### Promote Your Workflow\n\nThe **Configure Workflow Menu** view lists each of the workflows owned by you or shared with you. The owner and number of steps are listed. Click on a checkbox under the **Show in Menu** column to promote a workflow it is displayed directly in the *Tool Panel*, just like a tool.\n\n<div class='indent'> <img src=\"/images/learn/workflow_tool_configure_tool_menu.png\" alt=\"workflow configure tool menu\" width=\"700\" /> <br />*workflow **configure tool menu***</div>\n\n<br />\n\nBe sure to **save** any changes using the button at the bottom of the page.\n\n### Return to the Analysis Home View\n\nOnce finished, a green bar indicating that the workflow was successfully added to the menu will appear at the top of the page when it is refreshed. Wait until this occurs to ensure that your changes are active.\n\nClick on **Analyze Data** to return to the **Analysis Home View** where the updated tool panel can be reviewed and the newly promoted workflow can be accessed directly.\n\n<div class='indent'> <img src=\"/images/learn/workflow_tool_go_to_analysis_home_view.png\" alt=\"analysis home view\" width=\"500\" /> <br />**analysis home view**</div>\n\n### View and Run Promoted Workflows\n\nReview the updated Workflow section in the **Tool Panel** to confirm the promotion.\n\n<div class='indent'> <img src=\"/images/learn/workflow_tool_your_workflows_in_tool_panel.png\" alt=\"updated workflow section\" width=\"200\" /> <br />*updated tool panel **workflow section***</div>\n\n<br />\n\nThen launch the workflow by clicking on the name.\n\n<div class='indent'> <img src=\"/images/learn/workflow_tool_run_from_tool_panel.png\" alt=\"run a workflow from tool panel\" width=\"700\" /> <br />***run a workflow** from **tool panel***</div>\n\n### Editing to Hide Intermediate Steps\n\nToo many steps displayed by default in the history after running a workflow \"tool\"? Consider hiding the intermediate steps. How many to display/hide depends on what is important to access or visualize in the history as an active dataset. Often just the last step is wanted as a result.\n\nStart by entering the **Workflow Editor** for the target workflow, then follow these instructions:  **[Basic Editing, Hidden Datasets](/learn/advanced-workflow/basic-editing/#hidden-datasets)**\n\nNot sure how to access or use the editor? That same wiki has all the help you need to get started.\n\n### Reminder About Sharing Workflows\n\nWorkflows can be shared just like other Galaxy objects.
