This will place it in your \"Saved Workflows\" list. \n* Lost your place? Go to the very top menu and click on \"Workflow\". \n* For a saved workflow in your list, click on the name to access the workflow pull-down menu. <div class='right'><img src=\"/images/learn/workflow_copy.png\" alt=\"workflow menu\" width=\"150\" /> <br />***workflow menu***</div>\n* Choose \"Edit\" to open the *workflow editor*. More instructions for \"how-to\" are below. Be aware that you can browser navigate away from this page, or close it using the menu, **without saving** if you do NOT want to keep the changes. BUT if you want to keep the changes, *be sure to **save** before leaving the editor*. \n* *If a workflow is very important to you, it is a good practice to make at least one exact **copy** of it.*  This is especially true for workflows undergoing active edits. How often do you copy it? Depends on how painful it would be to re-do the work if you accidentally forget to save, or save a change that you  end up not liking. You will be warned in the UI before leaving the editor with unsaved changes, but these sorts of things still do happen...\n<br />\n## Extract workflow from a history\n<p>Do you already have an analysis path created in a history? Then your new workflow is just a few clicks away.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"/learn/advanced-workflow/extract/\">Learn how...</a></strong></p>\n<br />\n## Basic editing\n<p>Understanding the layout and basic usage options of the workflow editor are powerful yet simple concepts to master. If you are just getting started with workflows, this is worth a review.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"/learn/advanced-workflow/basic-editing/\">Read more...</a></strong></p>\n<br />\n## Using variables\n<p>A special option of advanced editing, making use of variables to control dataset names can be used to improve clarity in output results. <strong>Note that this functionality is undergoing active changes and may not work exactly as in the example at this time</strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"/learn/advanced-workflow/variables/\">Details here...</a></strong></p>\n<br />\n## Turn your workflow into a tool?\n<p>Well, not exactly, but it can <em>look</em> just like a tool in the tool menu pane and <em>function</em> very much like a tool in the history pane. Does the rest matter? Likely not, since full detail/reproducibility is still preserved (is just hidden from default view that can be unhidden for review, permanently or temporarily).
