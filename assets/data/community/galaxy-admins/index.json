This proposal got a huge response, and thus this group was born.\n\nThis community currently continues on [Galaxy Project Gitter \"Admins\"](https://gitter.im/galaxyproject/admins), while the [Development Round Table](https://galaxyproject.org/community/devroundtable/) working group continues the more development focused discussions.\n\nMeetups\n-------\n\nThe group used to [meet up](/community/galaxy-admins/meetups/) the third Thursday of every two month (starting February) unless otherwise notified, and irregularly at [Galaxy-related events](/events/), such as [GCC2016](https://web.archive.org/web/http://gcc2016.iu.edu/). The final in person gathering under this name was during [GCCBOSC 2018](https://gccbosc2018.sched.com/event/FMQW/bof-galaxyadmins).\n"}},"context":{}}
