One of those suggestions was to spend the next call on followup, so that's what we are doing.\n\n### Reference / Wiki\n\nAction items from BoF:\n\n* Want a knowledge base with different descriptions of Galaxy Deployments\n* Possibly have an Admin/Logs section where people can describe what they did\n* Add a list of Admin Tutorials to Admin and Cloud Hub pages, similar to what is on the Learn hub page. \n\nDraft implementations of the first two are in place:\n\n* Community/Deployments hub page\n* Community/Logs hub page (since moved to the [Galaxy Blog](/src/blog/index.md)\n\nWhat do people think of this approach?  The use of *boxes* on the right side is used to create much more informative lists of deployments and logs on their hub pages, using the [http://moinmo.in/MacroMarket/DictColumns](http://moinmo.in/MacroMarket/DictColumns) macro.\n\n### Mailing Lists / Forums\n\nDecided against creating a separate GalaxyAdmins mailing list.  See [BoF page](/src/events/gcc2013/bof/galaxy-admins/index.md#mailing-lists--forums) for details.\n\n### Meetups\n\n* Next meetup may be at a more Asia/Australia friendly time.\n\n### Leadership / Governance\n\nNotes from the BoF:\n* Nothing was established here.\n* Srinivas and Dave C will continue as is, but the right thing to do is transfer Srinnivas's responsibilities to someone else.\n* Participants will think about what to do\n* Distributing workload might work\n* Dave's willing to continue lining up speakers every other month.\n\n<br /><br />\n\n## Call Technology\n\nWe will use the University of Iowa's Blackboard system for the call. **Downloading and launching the required Java application takes a few minutes. Using a headphone with microphone to prevent audio feedback during the call is recommended.**\n\n<br />\n"}},"context":{}}
