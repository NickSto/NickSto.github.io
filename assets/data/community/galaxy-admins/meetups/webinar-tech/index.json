Tips\n---------------------------------------------\n\nYou do not need any special client, just a web browser and Java installed (the client will run as a Java web start app).\n\n**If you are using a recently updated version of Mac OS X, you will need to take [some extra steps](/community/galaxy-admins/meetups/webinar-tech/#java-web-start-on-mac-os-x) to get Java Web Start to work.**\n\nIf you have headphones they greatly improve your audio and *a headset really helps when you are speaking.*\n\nA couple of things to mention, when you launch your session - you can tune your connection speed:\n\n![](./BlackboardConnectionSpeed.png)\n\nTalking works like a walkie-talkie ... you have to select \"Talk\" (see capture below) to open up your audio line. There can only be 6 simultaneous talkers.  Please only select the talk button when you need to actually talk to reduce background noise and to free up lines for others to participate.\n\n![](./BlackboardTalk.png)\n\nJava Web Start on Mac OS X\n--------------------------\n\n<div class='right solid'>\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td style=\" border: none;\"> <img src=\"/images/logos/AppleLogo.jpg\" alt=\"\" height=\"50\" /> +<img src=\"/images/logos/JavaLogo.png\" alt=\"\" height=\"50\" /> </td>\n    <td style=\" border:none;\"> = <img src=\"/images/icons/Frown.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"50\" /> </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td style=\" border: none;\"> <img src=\"/images/logos/AppleLogo.jpg\" alt=\"\" height=\"50\" /> + <img src=\"/images/logos/JavaLogo.png\" alt=\"\" height=\"50\" /> + <img src=\"/images/icons/PointingFinger.png\" alt=\"You\" width=\"50\" /> </td>\n    <td style=\" border:none;\"> = <img src=\"/images/icons/Smile.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"50\" /> </td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n</div>\n\nIf you are running any moderately recent version of OS X, you may need to take some additional steps.  See this [RacoonLab posting](http://www.racoonlab.com/2013/01/java-web-service-doesnt-start-bad-installation-no-jre-found-in-configuration-file/) for details.\n\n**How do I know I have this problem?**\n\nThese two situations are known to be fixed with this solution:\n\n1. If the `meeting.jnlp` file downloads but doesn't launch automatically, or even after you double click on it then\n\n<div class='indent'>\n\nStart a shell, go to your downloads directory and type\n\n`javaws meeting.jnlp`\n\nif you see\n\n`Java Web Start splash screen process exiting .....`\n\n<div class='right'><img src=\"./BlackboardHang1.png\" alt=\"Blackboard Hang\" width=\"300\" /></div>\n\n`Bad installation. No JRE found in configuration file`\n\n</div>\n\n1. Blackboard Collaborate launches, says loading, gets to 3 of 5 dots on the status indicator and then throws up a blank gray window\n\nthen\n\nyou probably have this problem.\n\n**How do I fix this problem?**\n\nIn the shell enter\n\n`sudo /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c \"Delete :JavaWebComponentVersionMinimum\" \\`<br />\n`   /System/Library/CoreServices/CoreTypes.bundle/Contents/Resources/XProtect.meta.plist `\n\nYou should then be able to launch the `meeting.jnlp` by double clicking on it.\n\nYou may also find that you receive a message indicating that the file cannot be opened because it was not downloaded from the Mac App Store.  This can be worked around by right clicking the `meeting.jnlp` file and clicking \"Open\" in the menu that pops up.
