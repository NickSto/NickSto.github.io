Ann is handing over the reigns to her fellow U Iowa colleague Srinivas Maddhi, whose day job is getting Iowa's Galaxy server into production.\n\nWe thank Ann profusely for her contributions, and Srinivas for taking this on.\n\nCall Technology\n---------------\n\nWe used the University of Iowa's Blackboard system for the call. Some care is needed to avoid getting feedback with participants without headphones. Therefore, *headphones are strongly encouraged.*\n"}},"context":{}}
