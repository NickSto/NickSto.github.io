Since 2015 the world has become much more aware of the need for codes of conduct, and best practices for creating and enforcing them have moved forward significantly.</p>\n<p><strong>As a result it is past time to update both our code of conduct and our process for maintaining it.</strong>  The first step in that has been to move the Code of Conduct to the Galaxy Community Hub, to make it more visible and to reflect that it is a document for the whole community.</p>\n<p>The Galaxy Outreach and Training <a href=\"/community/wg/\">Working Group</a> is has started working on a first draft of a new code and new processes.  The final code and processes we adopt will be implemented only after it has been discussed, revised, and approved by the community.</p>\n<p>Watch this space (and Galaxy channels of course).</p>\n<h2 id=\"galaxy-project-code-of-conduct\"><a href=\"#galaxy-project-code-of-conduct\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Galaxy Project Code of Conduct</h2>\n<p>This code of conduct outlines our expectations for participants within the\nGalaxy community, as well as steps to reporting unacceptable behavior. We are\ncommitted to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all and expect\nour code of conduct to be honored. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may\nbe banned from the community.</p>\n<p>Our open source community strives to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Be friendly and patient.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Be welcoming</strong>: We strive to be a community that welcomes and\nsupports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not\nlimited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour,\nimmigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual\norientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status,\npolitical belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.</li>\n<li><strong>Be considerate</strong>: Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn\nwill depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users\nand colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when\nmaking decisions. Remember that we're a world-wide community, so you might\nnot be communicating in someone else's primary language.</li>\n<li><strong>Be respectful</strong>: Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is\nno excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some\nfrustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a\npersonal attack. It’s important to remember that a community where people\nfeel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.</li>\n<li><strong>Be careful in the words that we choose</strong>: We are a community of\nprofessionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do\nnot insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary\nbehavior aren't acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to: Violent\nthreats or language directed against another person, Discriminatory jokes and\nlanguage, Posting sexually explicit or violent material, Posting (or\nthreatening to post) other people’s personally identifying information\n(“doxing”), Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms,\nUnwelcome sexual attention, Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above\nbehavior, Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to\nstop, then stop.</li>\n<li><strong>Try to understand why we disagree</strong>: Disagreements, both social and\ntechnical, happen all the time. It is important that we resolve disagreements\nand differing views constructively. Remember that we’re different. Diversity\ncontributes to the strength of our community, which is composed of people\nfrom a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different\nperspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a\nviewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to\nerr and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping\nto resolve issues and learning from mistakes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"diversity-statement\"><a href=\"#diversity-statement\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Diversity Statement</h3>\n<p>We encourage everyone to participate and are committed to building a community\nfor all. Although we will fail at times, we seek to treat everyone both as\nfairly and equally as possible. Whenever a participant has made a mistake, we\nexpect them to take responsibility for it. If someone has been harmed or\noffended, it is our responsibility to listen carefully and respectfully, and do\nour best to right the wrong.</p>\n<p>Although this list cannot be exhaustive, we explicitly honor diversity in age,\ngender, gender identity or expression, culture, ethnicity, language, national\norigin, political beliefs, profession, race, religion, sexual orientation,\nsocioeconomic status, and technical ability. We will not tolerate\ndiscrimination based on any of the protected characteristics above, including\nparticipants with disabilities.</p>\n<h3 id=\"reporting-issues\"><a href=\"#reporting-issues\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Reporting Issues</h3>\n<p>If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns,\nplease report it to any combination of the following people that makes you feel\nthe most comfortable:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dave Clements (clementsgalaxy@gmail.com).
