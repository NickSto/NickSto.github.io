These tokens are used to validate your identity for\nthe first time, and re-validate when the tokens are expired. You can revoke these tokens (a complementary step to\nthe disconnect process), which will (a) invalidate the tokens stored in Galaxy's database, and (b) will prevent Galaxy\nfrom being able to refresh expired tokens. </p>\n<p>To do so, visit <a href=\"https://myaccount.google.com/permissions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this page</a>, click on the icon of the Galaxy\ninstance (you may see multiple (and possibly similar) Galaxy icons, if you have logged in to multiple Galaxy\ninstances), and then click on the <em>REMOVE ACCESS</em> button. Note, the name and icon of Galaxy instances\non this page can vary, as these info are provided by an admin of a Galaxy instance and each admin can decide for\ndifferent name and icon. However, once you clicked on the icon, Google informs you about the homepage and type of\naccess the application has. </p>\n<div class=\"alert alert-info\" role=\"alert\">\n    **Note:**\n    \n    Your Galaxy account is independent from your third-party identity (e.g., Google account). \n    Therefore, regardless of disconnecting your third-party identity or revoking Galaxy's \n    OIDC-based access to your account, your Galaxy account stays active. The only tie this \n    account has to your third-party identity after the disconnect and access revoke, is\n    your email address. To delete this, you need to delete your Galaxy user.\n</div>\n \n"}},"context":{}}
