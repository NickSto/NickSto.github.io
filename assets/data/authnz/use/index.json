Depending\non the method you choose, you may be creating a Galaxy user account explicitly\n(i.e., define a Galaxy username and password) or implicitly (i.e., you would not\ndefine a username and password, instead you will login with your social identities).\nIn this sections we will explain how to use each of these methods.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/authnz/use/gxy/\">Explicitly create a Galaxy user account</a>;</li>\n<li><a href=\"/authnz/use/oidc/\">Use your social identities</a>, such as your Google\naccount.</li>\n</ul>\n"}},"context":{}}
