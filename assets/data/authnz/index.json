For instance, anyone can use\n<a href=\"https://usegalaxy.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Galaxy <strong>Main</strong></a> without having to create a user account. Despite of its convenience,\nanonymous users can only benefit from a subset of Galaxy's features. For instance, they cannot save their\n<a href=\"/tutorials/histories/\">histories</a>, workflows, or visualization. Therefore, to fully appreciate Galaxy's features, researchers are required to have a user account on Galaxy.</p>\n<p>For user's convenience, Galaxy offers a wide-variety of methods to create a user account:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"/authnz/use/gxy/\">Galaxy Username and Password</a>:</strong>\nThis has a built-in mechanism for creating user accounts via a local\nusername and password. Without any additional configuration, Galaxy uses its database to\nmaintain usernames and passwords, and stores passwords encrypted using\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2 (PBKDF2)</a> algorithm.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"/authnz/use/oidc/\">OpenID Connect (OIDC)</a>:</strong>\nLeveraging the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID_Connect\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">OIDC protocol</a>,\nlogin to Galaxy is enabled without explicitly creating a local Galaxy user account. This protocol is the current latest\nindustry-level standard for user authentication, and has been widely adopted by various platforms. This mechanism\ncan be used in combination with the Galaxy username and password option.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"/admin/config/external-user-auth/\">External authentication</a>:</strong>\nThis framework allows an instance of Galaxy to\ndelegate authentication to an external authentication system such as\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)</a>\nserver, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluggable_authentication_module\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM)</a>,\nor an upstream proxy server (e.g., <a href=\"https://www.nginx.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NGINX</a> or <a href=\"https://httpd.apache.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Apache</a>).\nThese systems are aconfigured to authenticate users and pass this authentication information along to Galaxy using\nthe HTTP remote user mechanism. Thus, by the time Galaxy is aware of a request, the user identity will have\nbeen determined and there will be no need for Galaxy to do any additional authentication work, such as\nshowing a login screen or checking user credentials. However, accepting an identity asserted by the Web server\ndoes not relieve Galaxy from having to create a user account for such an identity. Thus, Galaxy automatically\ncreates a user for each identity of this kind, recording that the user is “external” and also creating\na random password in order to effectively disable traditionally performed logins for the user.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Depending on your role/interests, please refer to the following pages for more details:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Admins: <a href=\"/authnz/config/\">read how to set it up</a>;</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Users: <a href=\"/authnz/use/\">read how to use it</a>.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"cloud-authorization-delegation\"><a href=\"#cloud-authorization-delegation\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Cloud Authorization Delegation</h1>\n<p>A user can leverage Galaxy to analyze their data stored on a cloud-based storage, and can also store their\nGalaxy datasets on a cloud-based storage (see <a href=\"/cloud/storage/\">this page</a> for details).\nThe ability to store/read data on/from a cloud-based storage, provides users with a (theoretically)\nunlimited storage space, and facilitates their data sharing through a cloud storage bucket.</p>\n<p>To access user's private cloud-based resources, Galaxy requires credentials to sign read/write requests to\nuser's storage account. However, Galaxy does NOT ask for users credentials as there are some drawbacks to\nthat, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>user credentials would grant a Galaxy instance with the same level of privileges as the user themselves;</li>\n<li>requires manual intervention to be revoked, and can affect all the other services users have setup with their\ncredentials;</li>\n<li>it adds liability concerns to Galaxy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Therefore, for user data security, Galaxy implements the current-latest protocols that allow users to\nsecurely delegate Galaxy to access their resources without having to share their credentials. This\nmethod leverages the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model implemented in cloud-based resource providers,\nand defines a separate role for a Galaxy instance, whose access can be restricted/revoked independent from\nuser's access. Providing Galaxy with the information about the role, Galaxy will then assume it\non-behalf-of the user.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"/authnz/cloud/\">this page</a> for the details on how we implement this\nmethod for different resource providers, and how it can be used.</p>\n</div>\n"}},"context":{}}
