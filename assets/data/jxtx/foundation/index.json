Towards the goal of advancing mentorship, JXTX will organize and host mentoring sessions between senior and junior faculty members at select high-profile meetings.</p>\n<p>The Foundation will later expand its reach as a platform for academic mentorship. First, it will operate to spark mentoring relationships among the larger computational biology and data science community. As part of membership, faculty and students will have an opportunity to participate in periodic mentorship meetings (virtually). We expect an enthusiastic response to this opportunity, and will recruit additional team members to provide organizational structure if necessary.</p>\n<p>In its later stages, the Foundation will sponsor in-person visits from students (high school or college age) to its hotspots, which currently include Johns Hopkins and Penn State. These visits are meant to attract new scholars to computational biology and data science, and in particular to form connections and opportunities for members of underrepresented minorities.</p>\n<p><strong>Please consider <a href=\"https://give.communityfunded.com/o/eberly/i/eberly-college-of-science/s/jtech#CommunityI39hubL9i\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">contributing</a> to continue James Taylor's legacy.</strong></p>\n"}},"context":{}}
