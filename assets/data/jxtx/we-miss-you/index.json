Hilser, Chair,Department of Biology, Johns Hopkins</footer>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">James Taylor was an amazing colleague, scientist, and friend. I love him very much and I will miss him very much.\n<footer class=\"blockquote-footer\">Bob Johnson, Johns Hopkins</footer>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\nJames was a truly wonderful mentor, scientist, and human being. He was so brilliant, but so approachable. He was a giant in the field and I was so lucky to have the chance to work with him. He will be deeply missed.\n<footer class=\"blockquote-footer\">Nathan Roach, Johns Hopkins</footer>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\nI am in shock and saddened over the horrible news that James Taylor has passed away.<br /> \nHe was a cornerstone of the bioinformatics community, and with his leadership Galaxy grew to tremendous heights. <br />\nSo heartbreaking, a true loss. My sincerest condolences to his family and all his friends. He will be sorely missed.<br />\n<footer class=\"blockquote-footer\">Stian Soiland-Reyes, University of Manchester</footer>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\nMassive contributions to bioinformatics and an amazing person.\n<footer class=\"blockquote-footer\">Ben Busby, DNANexus</footer>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\nThis is a such a tragic loss. Thank you, James, for being such a supportive mentor and friend. We will miss you.\n<footer class=\"blockquote-footer\">Rajiv McCoy, Johns Hopkins</footer>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\nWhat a tragedy.  He was a terrific researcher and an awesome human being.    A huge loss for the world.<br />\nYou were a hero James &mdash; we'll do our best to carry on your work.   RIP, we will all miss you terribly!\n<footer class=\"blockquote-footer\">Dan Stanzione, TACC</footer>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\nThis is devastating news. James Taylor will be missed by our entire community and well beyond. All my condolences to his family\n<footer class=\"blockquote-footer\">Cedric Notredame, CRG</footer>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\nThis is just such devastating news. I have known James for the best part of seven years, as we set up Galaxy in Australia and James, of course, immediately agreed to visit in 2013 to help make that happen. He was visionary, looking to create free, open platforms for global science. <br /><br />\nHe was also enormously good company, going out for beers and in depth discussions on any and all topics. I thoroughly enjoyed James' company in social and academic forums...but far more importantly than that, he both led and built software and data science communities that will define community-focussed global bioscience from here on. <br /><br />\nPersonally, it's crushing - I am so sorry for his family and friends, of which of course I count myself - but the loss to the world of science eclipses that. We are all the poorer for losing James. If it is any consolation, he accomplished so much - the world of science is changed because of James.\n<footer class=\"blockquote-footer\">Andrew Lonie, University of Melbourne</footer>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\nI am in shock. James was a great scientist, great person, and a cornerstone of the Jetstream effort.\n<footer class=\"blockquote-footer\">Craig Stewart, Indiana University</footer>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\nI'm so very sorry to hear this news. A wonderful person and scientist who made awesome contributions to science. He will be greatly missed. Heartfelt wishes to his family, friends and all the Galaxy crew.\n<footer class=\"blockquote-footer\">Vivien Bonazzi, NIH</footer>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\nMy condolences. The galaxy project has grown such a supportive and positive community around it, and Dr. Taylor was right at the center of it.\n<footer class=\"blockquote-footer\">Dan Fornika, BCCDC</footer>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\nI am utterly shocked and terribly saddened to hear this. James has been a wonderful colleague, collaborator, and a great mentor to many students.\n<footer class=\"blockquote-footer\">Steven Salzberg, Johns Hopkins</footer>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a

This hurts\n<footer class=\"blockquote-footer\">Chris Fields, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign</footer>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\nMy friend James Taylor is dead. I'm heartbroken and thinking of all of his family and friends. He is leaving a hole that cannot be filled.<br /><br />\nI met James when I started grad school at Penn State. I had no idea what to expect (I'd only learned of PhD programs within the previous year). We were both students, but he was clearly in a league of his own.<br /><br />\nJames was one of the smartest people I've ever known, in a way that wasn't (as) intimidating. Talking with James was easy and enlightening. He advocated and put in the work for better science, in all aspects.<br /><br />\nJames supported my science and my career in ways I don't think I can ever fully communicate. As a colleague, he believed in me. As a friend, he expected me to do good. He supported my growth, selflessly.<br /><br />\nMost of all, James was an advocate. <br /><br />\nHe advocated for his students, for trainees, for open science, for open data, for making this world a better place. <br /><br />\n<p>I will miss him so terribly.</p>\n<footer class=\"blockquote-footer\">Melissa A. Wilson, Arizona State University</footer>\n<br />\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\nWhat a beautiful tribute, Melissa. James was my colleague in the Hopkins Biology department.

We are all shocked and saddened. Such a loss to us all. Thoughts are with his family and friends.\n<footer class=\"blockquote-footer\">Carole Goble, University of Manchester</footer>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\nJames was so approachable. Though we never got the chance to collaborate directly, when I first met *the* James Taylor I remember feeling that approachability in that someone so famous in our field would always take the time out to talk to me about science or about whatever the topic of the moment was. We had many conversations - some just a glance across a busy crowd at a conference where that would be our only acknowledgement, some,  hours long chats. The first memory that came to mind thinking back now was the many weeks he spent at CSHL instructing at courses in the fall. There were months when he was on campus more than I was. The particular memory that flashed when I heard this news was finishing a beer with him around 2 am in the cold outside the bar at Blackford. The bar had long closed, but we were having a crazy conversation along with one other course instructor about awful American TV shows. The conversation was of course punctuated with thoughts on comparative genomics. James was brilliant, but it wasn’t this that made him a star, helped him build a global community, or an enduring vision. He was a lovable and decent human being who will be fondly remembered. His work and the community he helped to create will live on. For every researcher who continues his legacy and works to live up to his achievements, don’t forget to bring along also his charm, curiosity, compassion, and love. \n<footer class=\"blockquote-footer\">Jason Williams, CSHL</footer>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\nTerribly sad news. He was kind enough to let my high school daughter tour his lab and was so supportive of her interest in science. My sympathies to his family and colleagues.\n<footer class=\"blockquote-footer\">Sally C. Morton, Virginia Tech</footer>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\nVery sad news and a great loss for the scientific community. James Taylor was a visionary leader in open science and reproducible research. My condolences to his family.\n<footer class=\"blockquote-footer\">Nils Gehlenborg, Harvard University</footer>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\nRest in peace. I will always remember you.\n<footer class=\"blockquote-footer\">Min Hyung Cho, Johns Hopkins</footer>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\nI feel very lucky to have been taught computational biology by James Taylor throughout this first year at Hopkins. Wish this could have continued and will miss him greatly.\n<footer class=\"blockquote-footer\">Sara Debic, Johns Hopkins</footer>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\nDeeply saddened by this. Such a tremendous loss for science! \n<footer class=\"blockquote-footer\">Mihaela Pertea, Johns Hopkins</footer>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\nCompletely in shock and saddened by this. He will be so missed.\n<footer class=\"blockquote-footer\">Jason Stajich, UC Riverside</footer>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\nI was fortunate to be introduced to James via the IU/TACC Jetstream project, where he promised to consume large quantities of CPU time on behalf of the Galaxy project. His vision and his plans for achieving it were both straightforward and clear. In short: Give us a key to your system (an API key, in this case), and we will make sure it's used for good. And he delivered, spectacularly! While this straightforward approach might at first appear naive, he articulated his plans clearly and proved soundly that he could do it. He was always ready to share examples of discoveries that had been enabled by Galaxy. In later visits on other topics, I was impressed by his astute understanding of how the research community works and how to make (important, substantive) things happen. People like him are rare and special, and a joy to encounter and work with. This is a heavy loss for the research community.\n<footer class=\"blockquote-footer\">Lee Liming, University of Chicago</footer>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\nI still remember the nice after meeting time we had with Nate in Collioure. I had nothing but the greatest respect for him and his work.

My sincere condolences to his family and friends. This loss is a burden that will be shared by many.\n<footer class=\"blockquote-footer\">John Fonner</footer>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\nJames was a great force for openness, community, and science.  He was a truly lovely man. I first met him in Oslo in 2013 and he was immediately welcoming even though he had no idea who I was. Over the years that followed we shared beers, meals, conversations, games and laughs. The thing I'll most remember about him is the glint of pride he got in his eye whenever he saw the wonderful Galaxy community get together. He and Anton created something amazing.<br /><br />\nMy sincere condolences to James' family, his colleagues and the rest of the Galaxy world.\n<footer class=\"blockquote-footer\">Simon Gladman, Australia</footer>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\nThe bioinformatics community has produced many stars; James was a galaxy.\n<footer class=\"blockquote-footer\">Andrew Stuart</footer>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\nExtraordinarily sad news in these already troubling times.

Vale James.\n<footer class=\"blockquote-footer\">Ross Lazarus, Australia</footer>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\nAs an undergrad, tinkering with pipelines and tutorials on Galaxy was how I started to learn about bioinformatics. James Taylor’s work to make these resources accessible and free changed my life.\n<footer class=\"blockquote-footer\">Sam Bogan</footer>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\nI just do not know what to say. My thoughts go to his family, friends, and to the great Galaxy Project community to which he was a father. Sincere condolences.\n<footer class=\"blockquote-footer\">Hervé Ménager, France</footer>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\nThis is so heartbreaking. I didn't interact with James that many times IRL, but those few moments witnessed strongly about his generosity and humbleness. This puts tears to my eyes and a makes my heart heavy. Rest in peace dear fellow human!\n<footer class=\"blockquote-footer\">Samuel Lampa</footer>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\nJames was my PhD advisor. For 6 years he patiently helped me become a better scientist and supported me for years after. <br /><br />\nJames you are one of the smartest and kindest person I have ever met and I will miss you very much!\n<footer class=\"blockquote-footer\">Olgert Denas, Adobe Research</footer>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\nWhat tragic news. My heart goes out to all those who loved him, his family, friends, colleagues, the Galaxy team and community.\n<footer class=\"blockquote-footer\">Maria Doyle, Peter MacCallum Cancer Center</footer>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\nMany aspects of what we are going through right now will pass with time. James' impact on many of us personally and on how science is done will live on and I suspect grow with time.\n<footer class=\"blockquote-footer\">Sean Davis</footer>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\nAlmost every project I've worked on since entering the field of bioinformatics has referenced Galaxy Project directly or indirectly. Sad for the loss of a great scientist, but inspired by the camaraderie of the community around good science, especially given current events. RIP.\n<footer class=\"blockquote-footer\">H M Dingerdissen</footer>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\nJames has been a part of our community since 2003 and this devastating news is hitting us hard, and doesn't feel possible. His brilliance and positive energy were undeniable and affected everyone lucky to have met and work with him. We we will miss you James.\n<footer class=\"blockquote-footer\">CSHL Courses</footer>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\nWe are deeply saddened by the loss of a wonderful person that was part of our CSHL courses family for many years. Im just heartbroken with the news. We will miss you Dr. Taylor, thank you for all your kindness. It was an honor working with you.\n<footer class=\"blockquote-footer\">Alicia Vanessa Franco</footer>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\nAs I write this from Colombo, Sri Lanka, one can only think of the impact that James has had across the entire world at such a young age, and how his untimely loss has taken away so much from it. The software and community that James was a chief architect of, has positively affected hundreds of thousands of scientists around the world. The loss felt by all of us in this vibrant, welcoming world-wide community that he helped to create, cannot be captured in words. Rest in peace James, the community and impact you have created will live on in your name.\n<footer class=\"blockquote-footer\">Nuwan Goonasekera, University of Melboune</footer>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote trim-p\">\nThis makes no sense.

Looking back it is clear that he and Anton convinced funders of the importance of community building, evident in how the Galaxy Project funded and has continued to fund dedicated staff for community, outreach and training. James cared both about people and principles - he was also vocal on open science and open data, embodied in the Galaxy platform's ethos of reproducible research. Just days ago, he was tweeting complaints about how in a pandemic so much new covid19 viral sequence data was not being shared openly (as in the NCBI/INSDC), but instead under restricted terms in the GISAID database. It is clear from the posts of his students, mentees, collaborators and friends, that while he would have achieved much more, he has already built a legacy we can all be proud of.\n<footer class=\"blockquote-footer\">Peter Cock, James Hutton Institute</footer>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\nI'm just a citizen scientist active in human genome analysis especially regarding Y-DNA J2 and ancestral and relatives haplotype clusters.

At the time I was attending as a lowly delegate from Africa, and engaging with a Galaxy project PI was quite a leap. We got talking and got to know each other over meetings and beers over the years. I cannot believe he is gone. His family and friends are left with a gaping hole in their lives. My strength to you (us) all.

I was a bit shocked when he replied, \"You should be incredibly skeptical.  You should use most of them and trust none of them.\"   I really admired this intellectual honesty, how he was able to teach and rely on many tools while still being highly objective and critical of them.  That is something I will always remember about him and carry with me as a guiding principle in the years to come.<br /><br /></p>\n<p>One of the privileges of being an academic is the opportunity to meet truly remarkable people, those who not only possess incredible intelligence but also incredible character.
