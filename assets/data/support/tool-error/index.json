When using the public <a href=\"/main/\">Main</a> Galaxy instance at <a href=\"http://usegalaxy.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http://usegalaxy.org</a>, see the walltime available on the different clusters <a href=\"/main/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Sometimes the execution time of a job can be decreased by adjusting the inputs, parameters used, or the cluster used (try <strong><a href=\"/main/\">Stampede or Jetstream</a></strong>, if available for the tool form under the section <strong>Job Resource Parameters</strong>). This solution is similar to jobs that error for exceeding memory allocation.</p>\n<p>If you are excuting a tool that runs on certain remote clusters (example tools: Trinity, Unicycler), the problem could be input problems, exceeding memory, or actually exceeding the \"wall-time\".

Please have the expectation that we probably can not solve your specific issue immediately, but cumulative feedback helps us to learn which tools would benefit from additional resource allocation.</li>\n<li>If the job remains too large to run at <a href=\"/main/\">Galaxy Main</a>(<a href=\"http://usegalaxy.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http://usegalaxy.org</a>)(<a href=\"http://usegalaxy.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http://usegalaxy.org</a>), then moving to an instance where more memory can be allocated to jobs is the solution. A good choice is <a href=\"http://usegalaxy.org/cloud\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CloudMan</a> as processing memory is easily scaled up. <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/grants/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AWS in Education</a> grants can help with costs. Another option is setting up a <a href=\"http://getgalaxy.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">local Galaxy</a>, if you have a computer/server with enough processing memory (16 GB minimum, but more is likely needed if the jobs are large, possibly up to 64 GB).</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"special-cases---memory-or-walltime\"><a href=\"#special-cases---memory-or-walltime\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Special cases - memory or walltime</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Certain inputs are very large and/or fragmented.</li>\n<li>Example 1: A highly fragmented transcriptome/genome used as a custom reference genome. The size is generally <strong>several thousands of \"chromosomes\"</strong> instead of one to a few dozen. Consider only using the primary chromosomes and skipping unmapped/unplaced/other partial data. Calculating or filtering by length can reveal the extent of the fragmentation and help you to make choices about how to proceed.</li>\n<li>Example 2: An entire NGS read dataset was used as a custom reference genome. The size is generally <strong>millions of \"chromosomes\"</strong>. <em>Fastq read datasets converted to fasta will almost never work with tools as a custom genome or build.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Moving to a local or cloud Galaxy will often not help for these cases due to how the 3rd party wrapped tool is written. The tool would fail outside of Galaxy, too. Finding or creating a better quality (less fragmented) target genome/transcriptome is the solution.</p>\n<h3 id=\"type-valueerror-invalid-literal-for-int-with-base-10\"><a href=\"#type-valueerror-invalid-literal-for-int-with-base-10\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Type: ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10</h3>\n<p>Full error is usually a longer message seen only after clicking on the bug icon <img src=\"/images/icons/bug.png\">:</p>\n<pre><code>stderr\n\n...\nMany lines of text, may include parameters\n...\n...\nValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'some-read-identifier-name'\n</code></pre>\n<h4 id=\"example---valueerror\"><a href=\"#example---valueerror\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Example - ValueError</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>MACS2 produces this error the first time it is run.
