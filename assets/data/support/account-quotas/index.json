However, if there are hundreds (or more!), or many large histories shared with you, clearing these up periodically (<em>unsharing</em>) could be worth it.</li>\n<li>The other person does not need to <em>unshare</em> a history for you. <em>Unshare histories yourself</em> on this page using the pull-down menu per-history.</li>\n<li><strong>View</strong> is a review feature. The data cannot be worked with but many details, including tool and dataset metadata/parameters are included.</li>\n<li><strong>Copy</strong> those you want to work with. This will <em>increase your quota usage</em> since that history copy is now one of your histories, but that will also allow you manipulate the datasets or the history itself, independently from the original owner. All History/Dataset functions are available if the other person granted full access to the datasets to you. Dataset sharing is a distinct option on the <em>Share or Publish</em> form. Only the original History owner can set the level of sharing (History only, or also Datasets). If you need Dataset access and it wasn't granted, you might need to ask the other person to <em>reshare</em> with the box for \"Also make all objects within the History accessible.\" checked. The other person can toggle sharing to \"off\" for review/changes, then toggled back to \"on\" after.</li>\n<li><strong>Unshare</strong> any on the list not needed anymore. After a history is copied, you will still have your own version of the history, even if later unshared or the other person who shared it with you makes changes to their own version of the history later on. Meaning, each account's version of a History, and the Datasets in it, are distinct (unless the Datasets were not shared -- then you will still only be able to \"view\" Datasets, but not work with or download them).</li>\n<li>Dataset and History privacy options, including sharing, can be set under <strong>User > Preferences</strong>. The automatic default is that none of your account data is shared.

Then <em>purge</em> them from the public server.</li>\n<li><strong>Copy</strong> Datasets or Histories to another Galaxy server, including your own Galaxy. Then purge.</li>\n<li><strong>Copy</strong> your most important Datasets into a new/other History (inputs, results), then purge the original full History. This can be a quicker alternative if the orignal History is very large or complex to review/purge dataset-by-dataset.</li>\n<li>Extract a <strong>Workflow</strong> from the History, then purge it. Workflows do not consume quota space as they do not contain any datasets, only tools/parameters. IF you first saved back the original inputs and final result datasets, the analysis can be rerun to recreate the intermediate datasets and to compare the new result with your original. Be aware that minor differences are expected over time, as tools and Galaxy itself are updated.</li>\n<li><strong>Back-up your work</strong>. It is a best practice to download an archive of your FULL original Histories periodically, even those still in use, as a backup.</li>\n<li><strong>In short, keep active work on the server and archive/download older work + backups of current work.</strong> You can always reupload prior downloaded Datasets or Histories later. Or, rerun an analysis with a Workfow and the original inputs.</li>\n<li><strong>Resources</strong> Much discussion about all of the above options can be found at the Galaxy Help forum <a href=\"https://help.galaxyproject.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://help.galaxyproject.org/</a> (in context with difference use cases).

Review the options below for some tips.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Navigate to a history (<strong>User > Histories</strong>) and use the history menu function \"Purge Deleted Datasets\". That will make sure that any datasets that were only <em>deleted</em> become <em>permanently deleted (purged)</em>. Note that <em>purged</em> data cannot be recovered, even by an administer.</li>\n<li>Navigate to a history (<strong>User > Histories</strong>) and use the history menu function <em>Copy Datasets</em>. Only active datasets will appear in the middle panel view listing of datasets. Select the datasets that you wish to retain and copy those into a new history. Once completed, go back and permanently delete (purge) the entire original history under <strong>User > Histories</strong>. You may need to log out then back into Galaxy again to reset the quota usage.</li>\n<li>If you copy a <em>dataset collection</em> to a new or different history, the <em>hidden</em> datasets associated with that collection are also copied.</li>\n<li>Copies of datasets within your own account do not individually count against quota usage -- these are \"clones\" unless a change is made (after a change, copies do become distinct datasets and count toward quota usage individually). If you change a copied dataset, consider updating/removing the original tag(s), or add more tag(s).</li>\n<li>Keep future histories smaller by breaking up analysis into different histories. You can always keep copies (aka \"clones\") of important or frequently reused datasets datasets in different histories. Examples include: reference annotation, custom fasta genomes/transcriptomes/exomes, processed results, original source read data (pre or post QA/QC).</li>\n<li>Sometimes it is helpful to add tags to datasets that are important or frequently reused to better keep track of datasets that represent the same original data in different histories. Tag the original dataset or dataset collection (#name-of-tag) and any copies will inherit that same tag when copied. </li>\n<li>Consider creating a dedicated history for important or frequently reused datasets. You can create a copy of that entire history to a new history, give it a meaningful name, then start a new analysis. </li>\n<li>Histories can also have tags added to help you keep analysis/data organized.</li>\n<li>To review all of your histories, go to <strong>User > Histories</strong>. Note that if you have many histories, that view may take some time to load. Be patient, it will load, and when you reload that view again within a short time period, the view will load/resolve quicker. The listing includes the history name, dataset state summaries, overall size of <em>active</em> + <em>hidden</em> + <em>deleted</em> datasets, associated history tags, sharing status, and the history state. Only <em>active</em> histories are shown by default. Use the <em>Advanced Search</em> function to review all histories with different states (<em>active</em>, <em>deleted</em>, <em>permanently deleted aka purged</em>). Only purged datasets and histories do not count toward quota usage. </li>\n<li>To review all of your datasets, go to <strong>User > Datasets</strong>. Note that if you have many datasets, then that view may take some time to load. Be patient, it will load, and when you reload that view again within a short time period, the view will load/resolve quicker. The listing includes the dataset name, associated tags, the datatype, and when the data was last updated. The view can be sorted by any of those attributes. You can also search and copy datasets from that view, plus navigate to the history where a dataset is located. Note: Only <em>active</em> datasets are displayed on that view -- <em>hidden</em>, <em>deleted</em>, and <em>purged</em> datasets are not listed and dataset cannot have the state changed. You must manage a dataset state from within the history containing the dataset.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"i-purged-but-still-need-more-space\"><a href=\"#i-purged-but-still-need-more-space\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>I purged but still need more space!</h2>\n<p>Account quotas are generally fixed at 250 Gb for <a href=\"/main/\">Galaxy Main</a>.
