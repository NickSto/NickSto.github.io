Good for smaller sizes in all browsers.</p>\n<p><strong>Download entire histories</strong> by selecting <em>\"Export to File\"</em> from the History menu, and clicking on the link generated.</p>\n<p><strong>Transfer/Upload entire histories</strong> after using <em>\"Export to File\"</em> from the History menu and generating the link or downloading the archive, do one of the following: 1) copy the link in the \"from\" Galaxy instance, <strong>then</strong> in the \"to\" Galaxy instance select \"Import from File\" from the <em>\"User > Saved Histories\"</em> page and paste in the link into the form OR 2) select a downloaded history archive file to upload it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>\"Tip\"</em>: If your history is large, consider using <em>\"Copy Datasets\"</em> from the History menu to move just your most important datasets into a new history, then create the archive from that smaller history. Copied datasets do not consume additional account quota space. Archive creation, download, and transfer will go much quicker with a smaller history not cluttered up with intermediate/error data, or any starting data that you already have and uploaded to Galaxy.</li>\n<li>The video <strong><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/galaxyproject/datasets1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Datasets 1</a></strong> includes help about different datatypes and what to expect in the download icon (one file or two!).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"large-datasets\"><a href=\"#large-datasets\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Large Datasets</h1>\n<h2 id=\"browser-option\"><a href=\"#browser-option\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Browser option</h2>\n<p>Download datasets from Galaxy to your computer by clicking on the \"disk icon\" within an expanded dataset.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Most datasets will only have one file per dataset.</li>\n<li>Datasets with a <code>bam</code> datatype will have two files per dataset 1) the <code>bam</code> dataset itself plus 2) the associated <code>bai</code> index. Download each individually. See <a href=\"/learn/datatypes/#bam\">Common datatypes explained: bam</a>.</li>\n<li>Datasets with a <code>fasta</code> datatype will have one file per dataset. If you need a fasta <code>fai</code> index, one can be created and downloaded. See <a href=\"/learn/datatypes/#fasta\">Common datatypes explained: fasta</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Dataset downloading incompletely?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Try using the <em>Google Chrome</em> web browser. Sometimes Chrome itself better supports continuous data transfers.</li>\n<li>Use the <strong>command-line option</strong> instead. The data may really be too large to download OR your connection is slower. This can also be a faster way to download multiple datasets plus ensure a complete transfer (small or large data).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"command-line-option\"><a href=\"#command-line-option\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Command-line option</h2>\n<p>From a terminal window on your computer, you can use <strong><a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/manual/html_node/Download-Options.html#Download-Options\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">wget</a></strong> or <strong><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">curl</a></strong>.</p>\n<p>The direct download link to a dataset can be obtained by right clicking the\nfloppy disk icon and choosing \"Copy Link Location\" (for most datasets) or\n\"Download Dataset/Download bam_index\" (for BAM datasets there are two\ndownloads). Once you have the link, type this (where \"$\" indicates the terminal\nprompt), so that the link is inside of single quotes. Like many commands, there\nare many options. These are examples commonly used with Galaxy.</p>\n<p>Here's what it looks like using 'wget':</p>\n<pre><code>$ wget -O '&#x3C;link>'\n$ wget -O --no-check-certificate '&#x3C;link>' # ignore SSL certificate warnings\n$ wget -c '&#x3C;link>'                        # continue an interrupted download\n</code></pre>\n<p>Or, using curl:</p>\n<pre><code>$ curl -o outfile '&#x3C;link>' \n$ curl -o outfile --insecure '&#x3C;link>'     # ignore SSL certificate warnings\n$ curl -C - -o outfile '&#x3C;link>'           # continue an interrupted download\n</code></pre>\n<h1 id=\"dataset-collections\"><a href=\"#dataset-collections\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Dataset Collections</h1>\n<p>For dataset collections and datasets within collections you have to supply your <a href=\"https://galaxyproject.org/develop/api/#enabling\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">API key</a> with the request. You can add it to the end of the collection download url, the command would look something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>$ wget https://usegalaxy.org/api/dataset_collections/d20ad3e1ccd4595de/download?key=MYSECRETAPIKEY\n</code></pre>\n<p>or</p>\n<pre><code>$ curl -o myfile.txt https://usegalaxy.org/api/dataset_collections/d20ad3e1ccd4595de/download?key=MYSECRETAPIKEY\n</code></pre>\n<h1 id=\"datasets-not-downloading-at-all\"><a href=\"#datasets-not-downloading-at-all\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Dataset(s) not downloading at all?</h1>\n<ol>\n<li>Check to see if pop-ups are blocked by your web browser. Where to check can vary by browser and extensions.</li>\n<li>Double check your API key, if used. <em>User > Preferences > Manage API key</em></li>\n<li>Check the sharing/permission status of the Datasets.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Review a dataset's permission status under <em>Dataset > pencil icon > Edit attributes > Permissions</em>. If you do not see a \"Permissions\" tab, then you are not the owner of the data.</li>\n<li>If the data was <a href=\"/support/account-quotas/#find-histories-that-have-been-shared-with-you-and-unshare-those-not-needed\">shared with you by someone else</a> from a Shared History, or was copied from a Published History, or you are Sharing or Publishing data, be aware that there are multiple levels of data sharing permissions.</li>\n<li><strong>All data are set to \"not shared\" by default</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>Global sharing, new/existing history, and new/existing data sharing preferences or status can be modified by you at any time under <em>User > Preferences</em> for data that you own.</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong><em>User > Preferences > Make all data private</em> is a \"one click\" option to unshare ALL data (Datasets, Histories).</strong> Review the pop-up details and confirm or deny the action. Note that once confirmed and all data is unshared, the action cannot be \"undone\" in batch, even by an administer. You will need to re-share data again and/or reset your global sharing preferences as wanted.</li>\n<li>Only the data owner has control over sharing/permissions.</li>\n<li>Any data you upload or create yourself is automatically owned by you with full access.</li>\n<li>You may not have been granted full access if the data were shared or imported or copied, and someone else is the data owner (your copy could be \"view only\").</li>\n<li>After you have a fully shared copy of any shared/published data from someone else, then you become the owner of that data copy.
