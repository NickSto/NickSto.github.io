This same menu is also where you will log in and out of Galaxy.</p>\n<p>Be sure to note that the public <a href=\"/test/\">Test</a> and <a href=\"/main/\">Main</a> instance <strong>usage policies are <span class=\"red\">one account per user<span class=\"grey\"></span></span></strong>, as stated in our <strong><a href=\"https://usegalaxy.org/static/terms.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Terms and Conditions</a></strong>. Also, make sure your email address is valid so that you can confirm your new account (emails are case sensitive) and so that our administrator can contact you if needed (rare, but you'll want the email!).Â </p>\n<p>The activation email will include a link and an abbreviated terms of usage explaination:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>By clicking on the above link and opening a Galaxy account, you are also confirming that you have read and agreed to Galaxy's Terms and Conditions for the use of this service (<a href=\"https://usegalaxy.org/static/terms.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://usegalaxy.org/static/terms.html</a>). Terms include a quota limit of one account per user. Attempts to subvert this limit by creating multiple accounts or through any other method may result in termination of all associated accounts and data.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Most <strong><a href=\"/use/\">other public Galaxy servers</a></strong> have similar usage terms. Ask them if this is not clear, before multiple accounts are problems.

Log into your existing account and update the email address under <em>User > Preferences</em>. DO NOT create another new account or it will be detected as a duplicate account. Any use of multiple accounts can result in data loss. FAQ: <a href=\"/support/account-updates/\">Reset password or Change email, username, password</a>.</p>\n<p>If you instead want to start over with a new account, delete your old account(s) first under <em>User > Preferences</em>, then create a new account.</p>\n<p>Note: Updating a registered account email address will not prevent ongoing multiple/duplicate account detection. If you have more than one, existing or new or older, review below about how to clear that up. Use just one account and problems are avoided.
