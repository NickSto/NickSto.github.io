Some of the services are user-facing applications (e.g., Galaxy) while others are dependencies for other services and are not used by end-users directly (e.g., NodeJSProxy). A complete list of services managed by CloudMan is available on the CloudMan Admin page; that page also allows you to control the state of those services. Below if a list of the available services; if additional information is available about a specific service, it is available by clicking on the service name:\n\n* [Post Start Script (PSS)](/cloudman/services/pss/) - a custom script provided via a URL that's run at the end of the server bootstrap process\n* [Cloudera Manager](/cloudman/services/cloudera-manager/) - an service manager used to deploy Big Data services (e.g., Hadoop)\n* [Cloudgene](/cloudman/services/cloudgene/) - a graphical user interface application for Hadoop-based workflows\n* [Galaxy](/cloudman/services/galaxy/) - the flagship service with more information available throughout this wiki; the application is available at the instance root URL/IP\n* Nginx - a proxy server used to serve static content and proxy URIs to local service ports\n* NodeJSProxy - a NodeJS proxy server used by the IPython Interactive Environment\n* Postgres - a dedicated, production-quality database used by Galaxy\n* ProFTPd - an FTP server used to upload large files into Galaxy\n* [Pulsar](/cloudman/services/pulsar/) - a remote job execution engine for Galaxy enabling cloud-bursting\n* [Slurmctld](https://computing.llnl.gov/linux/slurm/slurmctld.html) - central management daemon for the Slurm job manager\n* [Slurmd](https://computing.llnl.gov/linux/slurm/slurmd.html) - compute node daemon for the Slurm job manager\n* Supervisor - [Supervisord](http://supervisord.org/) daemon used to manage select services (e.g., NodeJSProxy)\n\nIt is possible to add additional service to CloudMan by implementing a [service interface](https://github.com/galaxyproject/cloudman/blob/master/cm/services/\\__init\\_\\_.py#L290) for the given application. [Get in touch with us](https://github.com/galaxyproject/cloudman/issues) if you're interested in adding a new service.\n"}},"context":{}}
