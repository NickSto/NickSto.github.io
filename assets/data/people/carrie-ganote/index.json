My recommendations are my own:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Taste of India - my favorite place for Indian food. A little pricy, but the butter chicken is awesome. Seats 20.</li>\n<li>Turkuaz - Turkish/Mediteranean food of good quality and medium price range. The veggie kabobs are my favorite but the lamb chops and pides are also great. Seats 15.</li>\n<li>Casa Brava - Near College Mall on the 9 or 3 bus. Seats 30. Great food that is reasonably priced. This is my favorite Mexican place.</li>\n<li>Uptown Cafe - Creole and Americana. Great atmosphere, medium price range. Seats 30. One of my favorite places.</li>\n<li>Monet and Farm - upscale places. Farm is hit or miss. Monet is usually great but very pricy.</li>\n<li>Chocolate Moose - Bloomington institution. Long lines but decent ice cream. It's a little hut in a parking lot.</li>\n<li>Siam House - service isn't the best, but decent Thai food.</li>\n<li>Little Tibet - good food, medium prices. A Bloomington institution.</li>\n<li>Jankos - Bloomington institution. I don't recommend this place - prices are outrageous. Steakhouse, Americana. Seats 20.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"bars\"><a href=\"#bars\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Bars</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Nicks - Bloomington institution. Play Sink the Biz if you are brave. Great bar for hanging out and conversation, with nooks and crannies that aren't too loud.</li>\n<li>Yogis - Cheap, food is ok. Great selection on draft.</li>\n<li>The Tap - Loud. Great selection on draft. Seats 20.</li>\n<li>Crazy Horse - Loud, fun, lots of options. Seats 25.</li>\n<li>Kilroys on Kirkwood and Kilroys Sports bar - loud, but can have good drink specials. Serve food. Seats 100. Cheap wings on Monday!</li>\n<li>The Irish Lion - Decent Irish food and a good bar. Pub grub is reasonably priced and fancy items are also available. Seats 50.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"wine\"><a href=\"#wine\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Wine</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Butler Tasting Room - This is one of my favorite places - it's in a quaint building on Walnut just north of the railroad. It's \"walkable\" for the sturdy of constitution from campus.</li>\n<li>Oliver Winery - The winery is just North of Bloomington and has a beautiful grounds. They close at 6 most nights, 8 on Saturday.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"shops\"><a href=\"#shops\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Shops</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Game Preserve - if you like board games and RPGs, this is for you. On the Bloomington Square.</li>\n<li>Vintage Phoenix - comic book shop on 6th St close to Walnut St.</li>\n<li>Caveat Emptor - a fun bookshop which is pretty much a fixture in Bloomington.</li>\n<li>Landlocked Music - if you need to take some vinyls home with you, peruse this store.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"hiking\"><a href=\"#hiking\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Hiking</h2>\n<p>I love to hike; my favorite places are Griffy Lake, the Deam Wilderness, and the Beanblossom Bottoms.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griffy_Lake\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Griffy</a> is close to Bloomington and has nice trails and a tranquil lake to watch birds or fish.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_C._Deam_Wilderness_Area\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Deam Wilderness</a> is about 45 minutes from campus, but a beautiful place for those who like to be lost in forests.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://sycamorelandtrust.org/beanblossom-bottoms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Beanblossom Bottoms</a> is a neat experience for seeing how much of Indiana existed before settlement - swamp and wetlands. The boardwalk keeps you up out of the water, but at this time of year you want some bug repellent.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n"}},"context":{}}
