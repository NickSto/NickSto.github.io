The focus of my work for the first year was in the area of cloud computing. I started by focusing on our multi-cloud infrastructure by contributing to CloudBridge and CloudLaunch, particularly working on integrating Azure. I then started working on deploying Galaxy on Kubernetes, and particularly contributed to the Galaxy Helm Chart and developed a CVMFS-CSI Helm Chart in order to leverage the capabilities of CERN's CVMFS in a Kubernetes context.</p>\n<p>I was first introduced to Galaxy through the <a href=\"http://www.lappsgrid.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LAPPSGrid project</a> during my undergraduate years at Vassar College where I worked as a Research Assistant with Professor Nancy Ide.</p>\n<h2 id=\"contact\"><a href=\"#contact\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Contact</h2>\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <th> Email </th>\n    <td> <a href=\"mailto:almahmoud@jhu.edu\">almahmoud@jhu.edu</a> </td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n</div>\n"}},"context":{}}
