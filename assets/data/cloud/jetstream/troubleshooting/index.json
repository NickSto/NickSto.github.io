If you queue jobs on your instance, but Galaxy won't actually execute any, try the following:\n\n1. [Connect to your VM via ssh](/cloud/jetstream/ssh/)\n2. Run the following set of commands. These will fix the hostname and restart the necessary processes.\n\n```bash\neafgan@js-172-144:~$ sudo /etc/init.d/fix_hostname.sh\nstop: Unknown instance:\nhostname stop/waiting\neafgan@js-172-144:~$ sudo supervisorctl\ngalaxy:web0                      RUNNING    pid 1518, uptime 2 days, 17:02:05\nmunge                            RUNNING    pid 1508, uptime 2 days, 17:02:05\nnginx                            RUNNING    pid 1511, uptime 2 days, 17:02:05\npostgresql                       RUNNING    pid 1506, uptime 2 days, 17:02:05\npre_postgresql                   EXITED     Apr 15 04:23 PM\nproftpd                          RUNNING    pid 1786, uptime 2 days, 17:01:58\nslurmctld                        FATAL      Exited too quickly (process log may have details)\nslurmd                           RUNNING    pid 1512, uptime 2 days, 17:02:05\nsupervisor> start slurmctld\nslurmctld: ERROR (abnormal termination)\nsupervisor> restart galaxy:web0\ngalaxy:web0: stopped\ngalaxy:web0: started\nsupervisor> exit\n```\n"}},"context":{}}
