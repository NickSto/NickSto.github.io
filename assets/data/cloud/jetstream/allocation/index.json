This page covers the process of getting an XSEDE *Startup* type of allocation. You will need an XSEDE account before you can proceed (visit https://www.xsede.org/ to create one).\n\n* Start your allocation process by visiting http://jetstream-cloud.org/allocations.php and clicking on *Submit and manage allocation requests* link. After you logged in using your XSEDE account, choose *Startup* type of allocation.\n\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/8RPpGbC.png\" alt=\"\" width=400 />\n* Next, set your role as a PI and click Next.\n\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/xqfxW30.png\" alt=\"\" width=400 />\n* In the next step, you will need to provide a title for your allocation and an abstract about your research. 100 words is sufficient. \n* Choose *Jetstream* as your desired target resource type and supply your anticipated usage for the duration of the project in [Service Units (SUs)](https://portal.xsede.org/knowledge-base/-/kb/document/bazo); projects are awarded on an annual basis so be careful not to forget about your instance left running when not in use. Note that 1 virtual CPU on an Jetstream instance corresponds to 1 SU. So, if you launch a 8 CPU instance, you will be using 8 SUs per each hour the instance is running. So, do some math and try to estimate how many SUs will you need each month.\n\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/BS9h6Kn.png\" alt=\"\" width=400 />\n* You will also ned to supply your CV. For *Startup* type allocation, adding supporting grants and publications is optional but feel free to add any.\n\n<div class=\"img-sizer\" style=\"width: 150px\">![](http://i.imgur.com/jlVRiTk.png)</div> <div class=\"img-sizer\" style=\"width: 150px\">![](http://i.imgur.com/e1r3q0a.png)</div> <div class=\"img-sizer\" style=\"width: 150px\">![](http://i.imgur.com/IfMUenh.png)</div>\n\n* Finally, submit your application and wait approximately one business day for the allocation request to be approved.\n\n<div class=\"img-sizer\" style=\"width: 400px\">\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/BgL7Phr.png)\n\n</div>\n\nAPI access\n----------\n\nTo use CloudLaunch (https://beta.launch.usegalaxy.org/) or access the Jetstream\nAPI programmatically, it is necessary to retrieve API credentials:\n\n1. Log onto the OpenStack dashboard\n   Visit https://iu.jetstream-cloud.org/dashboard and login using your TACC\n   credentials. TACC credentials are the ones you can obtain and/or login at\n   https://portal.xsede.org/. The *Domain* field is always set to *tacc*.\n\n<a href=\"/cloud/jetstream/allocation/jetstream-os-dashboard.png\">\n    <img src=\"./jetstream-os-dashboard.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"75%\" />\n</a><br /><br />\n\n2. Navigate to the *API Access* page and download the *OpenStack RC File v3*:\n\n<a href=\"/cloud/jetstream/allocation/jetstream-os-api-creds.png\">\n    <img src=\"./jetstream-os-api-creds.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"75%\" />\n</a><br /><br />\n\nBy default, when using this file, you will be prompted for your TACC account\npassword. A more convenient but less secure approach is to save the password\ndirectly in the file by editing it as follows (note the two lines being\ncommented and the value of `OS_PASSWORD` variable set):\n\n<a href=\"/cloud/jetstream/allocation/rc.png\">\n    <img src=\"./rc.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"75%\" />\n</a><br /><br />\n\n### Using API credentials for CloudLaunch\n\nAfter you have downloaded the API access credentials, you can use them to launch\ninstance using CloudLaunch. Head to https://beta.launch.usegalaxy.org/ and\nchoose an application you would like to launch. Note that not all applications\nsupport all clouds.\n\nOn the application launch page, you will need to provide your credentials.\nThe easiest method is to load them from the file we downloaded in the previous\nstep.\n\n<a href=\"/cloud/jetstream/allocation/cl-load-creds-1.png\">\n    <img src=\"./cl-load-creds-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"75%\" />\n</a><br /><br />\n\nOnce the file is loaded, fill in any missing fields and validate the\ncredentials.\n\n<a href=\"/cloud/jetstream/allocation/cl-load-creds-2.png\">\n    <img src=\"./cl-load-creds-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"75%\" />\n</a><br /><br />\n\nIf the credentials authenticate, click *Next* to proceed.\n\n<a href=\"/cloud/jetstream/allocation/cl-load-creds-3.png\">\n    <img src=\"./cl-load-creds-3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"75%\" />\n</a><br /><br />\n\nYou also have an option to save the uploaded credentials to the server\nand in the future you will be able to just select the credentials from\nthe appropriate menu:\n\n<a href=\"/cloud/jetstream/allocation/cl-load-creds-4.png\">\n    <img src=\"./cl-load-creds-4.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"75%\" />\n</a><br /><br />\n\n**Note** that for the time being, if you launch instances via CloudLaunch, it will be\nnecessary to shut them down using the Jetstream OpenStack Dashboard\n(https://iu.jetstream-cloud.org/dashboard).\n"}},"context":{}}
