Do so by selecting the server you wish to restart, click the *Reboot* button and choose *Hard Reboot* option on the popup that shows up. The server will typically take a couple of minutes to reboot with Galaxy automatically starting up.\n\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/LU0fHQM.png\" alt=\"\" width=300 /> \n\n<div class=\"img-sizer\" style=\"width: 300px\">\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/2hUQCiD.png)\n\n</div>\n\n---\n\nWhere are Galaxy's log files?\n-----------------------------\n\nLog files are available for problem diagnosis.
