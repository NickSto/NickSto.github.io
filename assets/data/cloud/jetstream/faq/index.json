Do so by selecting the server you wish to restart, click the *Reboot* button and choose *Hard Reboot* option on the popup that shows up. The server will typically take a couple of minutes to reboot with Galaxy automatically starting up.\n\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/LU0fHQM.png\" alt=\"\" width=300 /> \n\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/2hUQCiD.png\" alt=\"\" width=300 />\n\n----\n\n## Where are Galaxy's log files?\n\nLog files are available for problem diagnosis.
